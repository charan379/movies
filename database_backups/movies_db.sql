One story line moves forward in time while the other tells the story backwards revealing more each time.\r\n-\r\nScion013\r\n\r\nA memory inside a memory, Memento is a complicated head spinning adventure. Leonard is determined to avenge his wife\'s murder. However, unable to remember anything that happens day-to-day due to a condition he sustained, short term memory loss, he has to write himself note after note that still don\'t mean anything after he falls asleep. The film goes back in time to reveal each little bit of the puzzle as he tries to find out the person who killed his wife and makes the audience feel just as confused as he is. The narrative closely follows a phone call Pearce has in which he talks about Sammy Jankis a former client of his who he believed had the same condition. The film takes an unexpected twist as the two characters have a lot more in common than is initially put across.\r\n-\r\ngab_b270@hotmail.com\r\n\r\nLeonard Shelby has short term memory loss resulting from an injury he sustained which was associated with the murder of his wife. He remembers his life prior to the incident, such as being an insurance claims investigator. He has learned to cope with his memory loss through dealing with a man named Sammy Jankis, a person he investigated professionally who also had short term memory issues. Some of these coping mechanism are to have a system of where to place things, talk to people face-to-face if possible rather than on the telephone as to be able to gauge their true intention, take Polaroids and write copious notes, the most important of those which he tattoos on his body so that they become permanent. Leonard\'s current mission is to find and kill his wife\'s murderer, who he believes is a man named John G., a name which is tattooed on his body. Over the course of a day, Leonard is assisted in this mission by a few people seemingly independent of each other, including a man named Teddy and a woman named Natalie. However, each time he meets them, he has no idea who they are, why they are helping him and if indeed they are working toward the same goal as him.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nLeonard is an insurance investigator whose memory has been damaged following a head injury he sustained after intervening on his wife\'s murder. His quality of life has been severely hampered after this event, and he can now only live a comprehendable life by tattooing notes on himself and taking pictures of things with a Polaroid camera. The movie is told in forward flashes of events that are to come that compensate for his unreliable memory, during which he has liaisons with various complex characters. Leonard badly wants revenge for his wife\'s murder, but, as numerous characters explain, there may be little point if he won\'t remember it in order to provide closure for him. The movie veers between these future occurrences and a telephone conversation Leonard is having in his motel room in which he compares his current state to that of a client whose claim he once dealt with.\r\n-\r\n\r\nPoint blank in the head a man shoots another. In flashbacks, each one earlier in time than what we\'ve just seen, the two men\'s pasts unfold. Leonard, as a result of a blow to the head during an assault on his wife, has no short-term memory. He\'s looking for his wife\'s killer, compensating for his disability by taking Polaroids, annotating them and tattooing important facts on his body. We meet the loquacious Teddy and the seductive Natalie (a barmaid who promises to help) and we glimpse Leonard\'s wife through memories from before the assault. Leonard also talks about Sammy Jankis, a man he knew with a similar condition. Has Leonard found the killer? Who\'s manipulating whom?\r\n-', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-04-08', '', '2020-04-08 07:04:44', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbbZ2zTBR_g', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 1, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::MA\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::14A\r\nChile::14\r\nFinland::K-15\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::14\r\nIreland::15\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG-12\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUkraine::16', 13),

Cobb\'s rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible, inception. Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea, but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime. But no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy that only Cobb could have seen coming.\r\n-\r\nWarner Bros. Pictures\r\n\r\nDominic Cobb is an spy who instead of breaking into a person\'s home, office, or even computer, gets the information he needs by getting into the person\'s mind through their dreams. Cobb is also a fugitive who misses his children. Someone approaches Cobb and wants to hire him but instead of getting information out, the man wants Cobb to implant something, a process called \"inception\", which is not easy to do. Cobb is hesitant to do it, but when the man offers to help Cobb go back to his children, Cobb agrees. So he assembles his team but when they begin, there are things Cobb didn\'t tell his team that could jeopardize the job, and when they occur, they\'re not sure if they should continue.\r\n-\r\nrcs0411@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nDominic Cobb is the foremost practitioner of the artistic science of extraction, inserting oneself into a subject\'s dreams to obtain hidden information without the subject knowing, a concept taught to him by his professor father-in-law, Dr. Stephen Miles. Dom\'s associates are Miles\' former students, who Dom requires as he has given up being the dream architect for reasons he won\'t disclose. Dom\'s primary associate, Arthur, believes it has something to do with Dom\'s deceased wife, Mal, who often figures prominently and violently in those dreams, or Dom\'s want to \"go home\" (get back to his own reality, which includes two young children). Dom\'s work is generally in corporate espionage. As the subjects don\'t want the information to get into the wrong hands, the clients have zero tolerance for failure. Dom is also a wanted man, as many of his past subjects have learned what Dom has done to them. One of those subjects, Mr. Saito, offers Dom a job he can\'t refuse: to take the concept one step further into inception, namely planting thoughts into the subject\'s dreams without them knowing. Inception can fundamentally alter that person as a being. Saito\'s target is Robert Michael Fischer, the heir to an energy business empire, which has the potential to rule the world if continued on the current trajectory. Beyond the complex logistics of the dream architecture of the case and some unknowns concerning Fischer, the biggest obstacles in success for the team become worrying about one aspect of inception which Cobb fails to disclose to the other team members prior to the job, and Cobb\'s newest associate Ariadne\'s belief that Cobb\'s own subconscious, especially as it relates to Mal, may be taking over what happens in the dreams.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nMr. Cobb a unique con artist can enter anyone\'s dreams and extract the most valuable ideas and secrets of people with the help of \"inception\" (a dream sharing technology) when the state of mind is at its vulnerable best. Cobbs ability has made him the face of corporate spying, hence a wanted man too. Seeing his abilities, he is approached by Saito to carry out an almost impossible mission not to steal, but to plant the idea into the mind of the legal heir of a billion dollar enterprenauer. Mr. Cobb, with some specialists, must do the impossible in order to get back his life in a completely different \"world of dreams\" facing his own demons.\r\n-\r\nMahesh Shelatkar\r\n\r\nDom Cobb is a thief with the rare ability to enter people\'s dreams and steal their secrets from their subconsciouses. His skill has made him a hot commodity in the world of corporate espionage, but has also cost him everything he loves. Cobb gets a chance at redemption when he is offered a seemingly impossible task: Plant an idea in someone\'s mind. If he succeeds, it will be the perfect crime, but a dangerous enemy anticipates Cobb\'s every move.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-04-08', '', '2020-04-08 08:36:11', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UN0bTV4aCw', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::G\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-12/9\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSlovakia::12\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUkraine::16', 12),

He is at the event of his daughter\'s wedding. Michael, Vito\'s youngest son and a decorated WW II Marine is also present at the wedding. Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part of the family business. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But when a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don\'s influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it. What follows is a clash between Vito\'s fading old values and the new ways which may cause Michael to do the thing he was most reluctant in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia families which could tear the Corleone family apart.\r\n-\r\nsrijanarora-152-448595\r\n\r\nMichael, the young and idealistic son of Vito Corleone, the head of the most powerful Mafia clan in New York, returns home as a war hero and is determined to live his own life. But tragic circumstances make him face the legacy of his family.\r\n-\r\nfiveisforsecret\r\n\r\nIn New York City, 1945, Michael Corleone, a decorated World War II veteran and son of Vito Corleone, the Don of the Corleone crime family, is determined to live a life with his greatest love, Kay Adams, and stay out of the family business. But with the health and status of his father slowly deteriorating, Michael begins to realize that some burdens cannot be avoided, and the inevitability of his fate as the patriarch of the Corleone crime family.\r\n-\r\ngoddangwatir\r\n\r\nThe story begins as \"Don\" Vito Corleone, the head of a New York Mafia \"family\", oversees his daughter\'s wedding with his wife Carmela. His beloved son Michael has just come home from the war, but does not intend to become part of his father\'s business. Through Michael\'s life the nature of the family business becomes clear. The business of the family is just like the head of the family, kind and benevolent to those who give respect, but given to ruthless violence whenever anything stands against the good of the family. Don Vito lives his life in the way of the old country, but times are changing and some don\'t want to follow the old ways and look out for community and \"family\". An up and coming rival of the Corleone family wants to start selling drugs in New York, and needs the Don\'s influence to further his plan. The clash of the Don\'s fading old world values and the new ways will demand a terrible price, especially from Michael, all for the sake of the family.\r\n-\r\nCharlie Ness\r\n\r\nVito Corleone is the aging don (head) of the Corleone Mafia Family. His youngest son Michael has returned from WWII just in time to see the wedding of Connie Corleone (Michael\'s sister) to Carlo Rizzi. All of Michael\'s family is involved with the Mafia, but Michael just wants to live a normal life. Drug dealer Virgil Sollozzo is looking for Mafia families to offer him protection in exchange for a profit of the drug money. He approaches Don Corleone about it, but, much against the advice of the Don\'s lawyer Tom Hagen, the Don is morally against the use of drugs, and turns down the offer. This does not please Sollozzo, who has the Don shot down by some of his hit men. The Don barely survives, which leads his son Michael to begin a violent mob war against Sollozzo and tears the Corleone family apart.\r\n-\r\nTheElfstone', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-04-08', '', '2020-04-08 10:19:03', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToQ8JJZQakY', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 1, 'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nAustria::16\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::14A\r\nChile::14\r\nColombia::18\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-18\r\nFrance::12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIreland::18\r\nIsrael::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::18\r\nPhilippines::R-18\r\nPoland::15\r\nPortugal::M/18\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::14\r\nSweden::15\r\nTaiwan::R-15\r\nUnited Kingdom::18\r\nUnited States::R\r\nWest Germany::16', 18),

Regarding the ongoing Michael Corleone story, it is about seven years since the events that concluded The Godfather. With the murders of the heads of the other four New York / New Jersey families, the Corleone family has unassailable control in New York. The move to Nevada went smoothly and Michael Corleone controls several hotels and casinos in the state. Frank Pentageli, the man who runs Michael\'s interests in New York, comes to Michael, asking if he can take out the Rosato Brothers as they are infringing on Pentageli\'s turf and business interests. However, the Rosatos are backed by Hyman Roth, a business partner of Michael\'s and a long- time ally of Michael\'s father, Vito Corleone, and Michael refuses. An attempted assassination attempt is then carried out on Michael\'s life, in his own home. Michael investigates who is trying to kill him, and suspects that there is a traitor in his family. Meanwhile. Michael and Hyman Roth fly to Cuba to finalise some business deals there. The Cuban trip reveals all. In a story interwoven with the present day, we see the backstory to Vito Corleone. From how his parents and brother were murdered by a Don in their home town of Corleone in Sicily, to his escaping, as a boy, to New York, his adult life and his rise to Don Corleone.\r\n-\r\ngrantss\r\n\r\nThe childhood of Vito Corleone and his rise from a petty criminal to the most powerful don in New York City during the early 20th century is depicted, whilst his son Don Michael Corleone succumbs to power, greed, and ruthlessness, all for the sake of pride and keeping the Corleone family intact.\r\n-\r\ngoddangwatir', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-04-08', '', '2020-04-08 10:20:46', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToQ8JJZQakY', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 1, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::18\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-18\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIreland::18\r\nIsrael::PG\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nMexico::C\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::PG\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::18\r\nPhilippines::R-18\r\nPoland::15\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::18\r\nSweden::15\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nUnited Kingdom::18\r\nUnited States::R\r\nWest Germany::16', 18),

Michael, approaching 60, is now thinking about his legacy. His charity, run by his daughter Mary, has just handed over $100 million to the Catholic Church. Michael also intends buying a large stake in International Immobiliari, a Vatican-run property company. Things are peaceful and stable but then Vincent Mancini, Sonny Corleone\'s illegitimate son, starts a feud with Joey Zasa.

He is running through childhood with his best and only friend Jenny. His \'mama\' teaches him the ways of life and leaves him to choose his destiny. Forrest joins the army for service in Vietnam, finding new friends called Dan and Bubba, he wins medals, creates a famous shrimp fishing fleet, inspires people to jog, starts a ping-pong craze, creates the smiley, writes bumper stickers and songs, donates to people and meets the president several times. However, this is all irrelevant to Forrest who can only think of his childhood sweetheart Jenny Curran, who has messed up her life. Although in the end all he wants to prove is that anyone can love anyone.\r\n-\r\naliw135\r\n\r\nThe movie Forrest Gump follows the life events of a man who shares the name as the title of the film. Gump faces many tribulations throughout his life, but he never lets any of them interfere with his happiness. From wearing braces on his legs, to having a below average IQ and even being shot, Gump continues to believe that good things will happen and goes after his dreams. While several less than ideal things occur during Gump\'s life, he manages to turn each setback into something good for him, such as when he finally gets his braces off he discovers that he is capable of running faster than most other people. This skill allows Gump to not only escape his bullies while he is a child in Greenbow, but also to gain a football scholarship, save many soldiers\' lives and become famous for his ability. While Gump eventually achieves the majority of the things he hoped to throughout the movie, it proved a much more difficult task to win the heart of his life-long friend Jenny Curran. The movie is centered on Forrest Gump and the incidences that occur during his life, but during each period in his lifetime he thinks back of Jenny and how important she is to him. Although the two characters grew up together and shared a very close friendship, as the movie progresses they grow apart. This upsets Gump who cares immensely for the girl who had a rough start in life, and it seems the two always end up back in each other\'s lives, often in extraordinary ways like meeting in the Reflection Pond in D.C. Even though Gump is the main character of the film, it similarly tells the story of Curran and the hardships she faces.\r\n-\r\nKathryn Logue\r\n\r\n\"Stupid is as stupid does\" is what Forrest Gump hears throughout his less than picturesque childhood. Though not as smart as the people he meets along the way, Forrest is thrust into some scary, crazy and downright incredible situations, rubbing shoulders with some great historical figures and escaping many dangers on sheer dumb luck. His giant heart and never fading love for his lifelong friend Jenny take him on a journey where he learns what his destiny is.\r\n-\r\nEd Morales\r\n\r\nA simple-minded but kind-hearted Alabama boy grows up with his best friend - a beautiful girl called Jenny. He succeeds in life through a mixture of luck and destiny and thus influences and is present at some of the most important events in the second half of the 20th century. Throughout his life he is told by other characters what life is about and whether it\'s all random or destined to happen, but he comes to his own conclusion towards the end.\r\n\r\nSlow-witted Forrest Gump has never thought of himself as disadvantaged, and thanks to his supportive mother, he leads anything but a restricted life. Whether dominating on the gridiron as a college football star, fighting in Vietnam or captaining a shrimp boat, Forrest inspires people with his childlike optimism. But one person Forrest cares about most may be the most difficult to save -- his childhood love, the sweet but troubled Jenny.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-04-08', '', '2020-04-08 10:24:25', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRODefoJO_M', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 1, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::PG\r\nDenmark::7\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::6\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::L\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::12\r\nIsrael::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::13\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::11\r\nPeru::14\r\nPoland::15\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::0+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::A\r\nSweden::11\r\nTurkey::7+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUkraine::ZA', 12);

However, an unfortunate discovery prompts Marty to go to his friend\'s aid. Using the time machine, Marty travels to the old west where his friend has run afoul of a gang of thugs and has fallen in love with a local schoolteacher.

But moments after, he got a letter from Doc that tells him he was sent to 1885. But the Delorean was damaged and he can\'t repair it. So he placed it somewhere where he hopes Marty can find it in 1955 and hopefully his younger version can repair it so that Marty can return to 1985. So he goes to the 1955 Doc Brown and tells him about what happened and shows him the letter. So they set out to find the Delorean and do which was hidden near a cemetery. After finding the Delorean, Marty and Doc were about to leave when they find a tombstone with Doc\'s name on it that says he was killed a few days after he sent the letter and that he was killed by someone named Buford Tannen. Marty and Doc go to the library and learn that Tannen was a crazed gunman and a photo of Doc in 1885. Marty then decides to go back to 1885 to save Doc. Upon arriving, the Delorean gets damaged and the gas tank is leaking. Marty then goes to town to look for Doc. But along the way he meets Tannen and gets on his bad side. Doc saves him and Tannen threatens Doc. Marty then shows Doc the photo of his tombstone. That\'s when Marty and Doc get ready to leave. But when Marty tells him about the gas tank, Doc tells him, without gas they can\'t get the Delorean up to 88 miles per hour to activate the time circuits. So they scurry to find a way to get it up to that speed before Doc gets shot. They think they found one which they plan to implement on the day he gets shot. Doc then meets Clara Clayton, the town\'s new schoolteacher and is smitten with her. That\'s when he has second thoughts about leaving. When Tannen tries to make a move on Doc, Marty stops him that\'s when Tannen challenges Marty to a gunfight. Marty initially declines but when Tannen calls him a coward, Marty accepts. Doc and Marty\'s ancestor tries to convince him he\'s making a mistake.\r\n-\r\nrcs0411@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of the trilogy sends Marty McFly on a rescue mission to the year 1885, where he must save Doc Brown from death at the hands of yet another member of the Tannen clan.

Dr. Emmett L. Brown and the time machine were somehow struck by lightning, and Marty somehow received a letter from Doc that he is okay, and in the year 1885. Marty and the 1955 Doc fix up the time machine after digging it up from a mine, then Marty discovers a gravestone with Doc\'s name on it, indicating that he will be killed by a man named Buford Tannen (Biff\'s great-grandfather).

Knowing that the country needs her husband to be able to communicate effectively, Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) hires Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), an Australian actor and speech therapist, to help him overcome his stammer. An extraordinary friendship develops between the two men, as Logue uses unconventional means to teach the monarch how to speak with confidence.\r\n-\r\nKing George VI\r\n\r\nTells the story of the man who became King George VI (Colin Firth), the father of Queen Elizabeth II. After his brother abdicates, George (\"Bertie\") reluctantly assumes the throne. Plagued by a dreaded stammer and considered unfit to be King, Bertie engages the help of an unorthodox speech therapist named Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush). Through a set of unexpected techniques, and as a result of an unlikely friendship, Bertie is able to find his voice and boldly lead the country through war.\r\n-\r\nKing George VI\r\n\r\nBiopic about Britain\'s King George VI (Colin Firth) (father of present day Queen Elizabeth II) and his lifelong struggle to overcome his speech impediment. Suffering from a stammer from the age of four or five, the young Prince Albert dreaded any public speaking engagement. History records that his speech at the closing of the 1925 Commonwealth exhibition in London was difficult for both him and everyone listening that day. He tried many different therapies over many years, but it was only when he met Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), a speech therapist, that he truly began to make progress. Logue did not have a medical degree, but had worked as an elocution coach in the theater and had worked with shell-shocked soldiers after World War I. Through a variety of techniques and much hard work, Albert learns to speak in such a way so as to make his impediment a minor problem and deliver a flawless speech heard around the world by radio when the U.K. declared war on Nazi Germany in 1939. The King and Logue remained life-long friends.\r\n-\r\nKing George VI\r\n\r\nIn the mid 1930s, King George V (Sir Michael Gambon) is concerned about the immediate future of the British monarchy. His eldest son David (Guy Pearce), first in line for the throne, is in a relationship with American divorcÃ©e Wallis Simpson (Eve Best). Marriage to a divorcÃ©e and being King of the United Kingdom (and thus head of the Established Church) are incompatible. King George V\'s second son, Albert (or \"Bertie\" as he is called by family, played by Colin Firth), second in line for the throne, speaks with a stammer, something he\'s had since he was a child. Although a bright and temperamental man, Bertie, because of his stammer, does not capture the confidence of the public, which is paramount if Britain does enter into war against Hitler\'s regime. As King George V observes about living in a communications age, a King can no longer get by in life solely by looking good in a regal uniform and knowing how to battle riding a horse. Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter), Bertie\'s loving wife, wants to help her husband gain confidence solely in his increasing need to speak at public functions, regardless if he becomes King or not. She finds an unconventional Australian-raised speech therapist named Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) to help assist in curing Bertie\'s stammer, with no one, even Lionel\'s family, knowing he has this job with His Royal Highness. Lionel and Bertie\'s relationship is often an antagonistic one as Lionel feels the need for the two to be equals during their sessions, with Lionel even calling him \"Bertie\" instead of \"Your Royal Highness\" in their sessions, which doesn\'t sit well with Albert, not used to such familiarity with a commoner. Lionel does, in time, become Bertie\'s confidante and friend, especially from Lionel\'s side as he tries to determine the psychological issues behind the speech impediment. An issue with Lionel (which he does not hide, but also does not fully disclose) may threaten their relationship altogether, which may be especially problematic as a still stammering Bertie ultimately becomes King George VI and Britain enters into war with Germany.\r\n-\r\nKing George VI\r\n\r\nIn 1925, the Duke of York (Colin Firth) is a stammerer and has trouble speaking to the public. His wife, Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter), seeks the treatment of speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) that follows unconventional methods and relationship, and Bertie gives up the treatment on the first day. However, after listening to the session that was recorded by Lionel, Bertie returns to the treatment. In the mid 1930s, the Duke of York is forced to assume the throne of the United Kingdom as King George VI, due to the abdication of his older brother King Edward VIII (Guy Pearce). Immediately afterward, there is a crisis in the government and Britain declares war with Germany. King George VI needs to make a speech to his compatriots, and his friend Lionel helps him using an unorthodox technique.\r\n-\r\nKing George VI', 'Blu-ray', 1, 0, '', 0, '2020-04-08', '', '2020-04-08 11:40:08', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcxBrTvLbBM', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE\r\nFinland::K-3\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::0\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nIndia::U\r\nIndonesia::R\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::18\r\nMexico::A\r\nNetherlands::AL\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::A\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::G\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::14+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::T\r\nSweden::Btl\r\nSwitzerland::7\r\nTaiwan::GP\r\nTurkey::G\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13', 0),

Upon their arrival in Zion, Morpheus locks horns with rival Commander Lock (Harry J. Lennix) and encounters his old flame Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith). Meanwhile, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) has returned with some surprises for Neo, most notably the ability to replicate himself as many times as he pleases. Neo makes his way to The Oracle (Gloria Foster), who informs him that if he wishes to save humankind, he must unlock \"The Source,\" which means having to release The Key Maker (Randall Duk Kim) from the clutches of Merovingian (Lambert Wilson).

Meanwhile, Zion is preparing for the oncoming war with the machines with very little chances of survival. Neo\'s associates set out to free him from The Merovingian since it\'s believed that he is the One who will end the war between humans and the machines.

Facing total annihilation, the citizens of the last bastion of humanity fight not only for their own lives, but for the future of mankind itself.\r\n-\r\nAnthony Pereyra {hypersonic91@yahoo.com}\r\n\r\nThe machine army continues to drill towards Zion. Within hours, they will overrun the population of the Zionites and lay extinction to human kind. Meanwhile, Neo is held captive by the Merovingian at the train station.

Also, Smith resumes his quest to kill \"Mr. Anderson\" as he reveals his identity into the real world and resumes to replicate his program inside the system of The Matrix, causing it to decay. All hope is placed in the freed Neo, who must travel to the city of the machines in the Logos ship with Trinity and bargain to save each kingdom from destruction by finishing Smith once and for all. But even with his new powers over the sentinels, will he be able to fight them off?\r\n-\r\nkeyser_soze-2\r\n\r\nIt is a dark time for the world. Neo is trapped in the \"Train Station\", between the Matrix and the Source. Zion is doomed to be crushed under an unstoppable army of countless Sentinels. But it is not only the human race that is in peril. The machines press ever onward against the humans, unaware that one force within the Matrix has slowly been growing, and has taken over that world completely: Smith. There is only one hope for both races, the one force that can stop Smith, and that is Neo. One final battle must ensue. And the outcome of this battle will decide the fate and future of both races.\r\n-\r\nMaxamillian King\r\n\r\nAs Neo somehow becomes trapped in a train station between The Matrix and the real world, Morpheus, Trinity, and Seraph set out to rescue him by means of the Merovingian. As this is going on, the Machines are approaching Zion with the intent of laying waste to every human there, but they do not realize that something is taking over The Matrix, with the intent of destroying everything: Smith. After Neo is freed, he and Trinity take the Logos and make a beeline for the Machine City. The Machines have reached Zion and the battle of a lifetime rages on. However, there is one way to save Zion and put an end to the war, and that is Neo. He must venture into the Matrix and put an end to Smith\'s evil plans once and for all, and if he succeeds, Zion will live to see another day.

Batman\'s struggle against The Joker becomes deeply personal, forcing him to \"confront everything he believes\" and improve his technology to stop him. A love triangle develops between Bruce Wayne, Dent, and Rachel Dawes.\r\n-\r\nLeon Lombardi\r\n\r\nThe follow-up to Batman Begins (2005), this movie reunites Writer, Producer, and Director Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale, who reprises the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne in his continuing war on crime. With the help of Lieutenant James Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent, Batman sets out to destroy organized crime in Gotham for good. The triumvirate proves to be effective. But soon the three find themselves prey to a rising criminal mastermind known as \"The Joker\", who thrusts Gotham into anarchy and forces Batman closer to crossing the fine line between hero and vigilante.\r\n\r\nGotham\'s new District Attorney has been elected. His name is Harvey Dent, and he has a radical new agenda that threatens to take down Gotham\'s organized crime underworld once and for all with an iron fist. But the emergence of the rogue vigilante known as Batman has caused problems for Dent and his agenda. A new criminal mastermind known only as \"The Joker\" has arrived and aims to take Gotham out from under Harvey Dent\'s iron fist. The Joker stages a masterfully planned bank robbery and robs the Gotham mob blind. He uses this money to stage a series of horrific and strategic attacks against the city and its people, each one carefully planned and aimed at Dent and Batman, while causing the rest of the city to enter panic mode. Meanwhile, Batman thinks he might have found a lead to The Joker thanks to Wayne Enterprises\' dealings with a shady Chinese banker, and that takes Batman and Alfred to Hong Kong. The Joker has no rules, but Batman has only one, and the Joker aims to make Batman break his only rule. But who will be the one to take him out, will it be rogue vigilante Batman, or will it be elected official Harvey Dent, the new hero with a face?\r\n-\r\nhalo1k\r\n\r\nOne year after the events of Batman Begins (2008), Batman, Lieutenant James Gordon, and District Attorney Harvey Dent plan to launch an attack on the mob by arresting the shady accountant of the mob, Lau. Lau is abducted from his building by Batman and is thrown into jail. Lau divulges the secrets which results in almost all the mob bosses thrown in jail. The desperate mob bosses turn to The Joker, a sadistic psychopath with green hair, completely yellow teeth, and a custom purple suit. The Joker kills a judge, the Police Commissioner, and tries to kill the Mayor and Harvey. The acts of The Joker produces anarchy and chaos in the people of Gotham, forcing Batman to come to terms to which may seem to be his greatest test to fight injustice and come closer to the fine line between hero and vigilante.\r\n-\r\nsrijanarora-152-448595\r\n\r\nWith the help of allies Lieutenant James Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent, Batman has been able to keep a tight lid on crime in Gotham City.

When learning about the plan to wipe out evil in Gotham City by Ducard, Bruce prevents this plan from getting any further and heads back to his home. Back in his original surroundings, Bruce adopts the image of a bat to strike fear into the criminals and the corrupt as the icon known as \"Batman\". But it doesn\'t stay quiet for long.\r\n-\r\nkonstantinwe\r\n\r\nAs a child, a young Bruce Wayne witnesses the death of his parents at the hands of a crazed criminal. As an adult, Bruce travels the world seeking the means to fight injustice. He lives amongst the boroughs of criminals and thieves in central Asia. Eventually, he meets a mysterious figure named Ra\'s Al Guhl and joins his gang called the League of Shadows. Using his training, he is able to defeat his trainer. Finally meeting up with his estate caretaker Alfred Pennyworth, Bruce Wayne returns to Gotham. There, he becomes the new head of Wayne Enterprises. Together, with the help of the C.E.O. of the Wayne Enterprises Applied Sciences division, a man name Lucius Fox, he dons a new persona: Batman. As Batman takes on the criminals and organized crime underworld of Gotham, a sinister new underbelly of the city is exposed, and a new class of criminal is born. Will Batman be the one to stop them all, or does Gotham need a hero with a face?\r\n-\r\nhalo1k\r\n\r\nBruce Wayne, who experiences the death of his parents at a very young age, relocates to Asia and trains with his mentors, Henri Ducard and Ra\'s Al Ghul in fighting injustice. He returns to a crime-ridden Gotham and with the help of his old butler and estate caretaker, Alfred, the C.E.O. of Wayne Enterprises Applied Science Division Lucius Fox, he dons a new persona, Batman, to strike fear into the hearts of the criminals and the corrupt. With the help of rising cop Gordon, and the Assistant District Attorney, and Bruce\'s love interest Rachel Dawes, he is able to take down the Mafia Don Falcone, and the twisted doctor/drug dealer Jonathan Crane a.k.a. The Scarecrow. With Ra\'s Al Ghul\'s return with his evil plan to destroy Gotham by inducing fear into the hearts of the people, Batman must defeat his mentor once again so as to bring peace in Gotham.\r\n-\r\nsrijanarora-152-448595\r\n\r\nBruce Wayne is still traumatized from that day he fell into the Earth and was surrounded by bats, or that night his parents were murdered. But when he arrives at the headquarters of the League of Shadows, he must conquer his fears and start his training. However, he learns that some things are not right for him in the League and he flees, having learned skillful combat and he saves his mentor\'s life. When he returns to Gotham, he learns that The Scarecrow is planning to dump a dangerous drug into the water supply to spread fear and panic throughout the population, only to learn that this plan is being maneuvered by someone much more familiar. Gotham might tear itself apart. Wayne must finally find a hidden identity and gain new power to save his city: Batman.\r\n\r\nAs a boy, a young Bruce Wayne watched in horror as his millionaire parents were slain in front of his eyes, a trauma which led him to become obsessed with revenge, but his chance is cruelly taken away from him by fate. After disappearing to the East where he seeks counsel with the dangerous but honorable ninja cult leader known as Ra\'s Al-Ghul, he returns to his now decaying Gotham City overrun by organized crime and dangerous individuals manipulating the system while the company he inherited is slowly being pulled out from under him. The discovery of a cave under his mansion, and a prototype armored suit leads him to take on a new persona, one which will strike fear into the hearts of men who do wrong, he becomes Batman. In the new guise, and with the help of rising cop Jim Gordon, Batman sets out to take down the various nefarious schemes in motion by individuals such as Mafia Don Falcone, the twisted doctor/drug dealer Jonathan \"The Scarecrow\" Crane, and a mysterious third party that is quite familiar with Wayne and waiting to strike when the time is right.\r\n-\r\nDark Horizons', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-04-08', '', '2020-04-08 11:54:07', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smOl5hvov2M', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::10\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nCzech Republic::12\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-11\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-13\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::D\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::G\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13', 12),

He can remember nothing and begins to try to rebuild his memory based on clues such as a Swiss bank account, the number of which is implanted in his hip. He soon realizes that he is being hunted and takes off with Marie on a search to find out who he is - and why he is being hunted.\r\n-\r\nPeet\r\n\r\nWhen a body is recovered at sea still alive, the mystery man (Damon) seems to have forgotten everything in life, including who he was. Eventually he begins to remember smaller details in life and soon finds out that his name was Jason Bourne. What he doesn\'t like is the gun and fake passports belonging to him. Now Bourne, and his new friend, Marie Helena Kreutz (Potente) travel from country to country in search of his new identity. But someone is not happy to see him alive, and is frantically trying to track him down.\r\n-\r\nPeet\r\n\r\nMatt Damon stars as Jason Bourne, a barely alive amnesiac with a pair of bullet wounds in his back, pulled from the Mediterranean by Italian fishermen. Bourne\'s only clue to his own identity is a bank account number etched on a capsule implanted in his body. He quickly finds the Zurich bank where money, a gun, and a few identification documents await, but after he\'s pursued by security goons at the American consulate, Bourne realizes he can trust no one and offers a German gypsy named Marie (Franka Potente) ten thousand dollars for a ride to Paris. Encountering more professional killers bent on his destruction, Bourne discovers that he possesses a surprising degree of skill in combat, martial arts, and linguistics -- handy talents that clearly indicate his past includes work as a spy and assassin, but for whom? With Marie\'s reluctant help, Bourne edges closer to the truth, something CIA officials want concealed at all costs.\r\n\r\nOn a stormy night, a young man is pulled out of the Mediterranean Sea by the crew of a fishing boat. Thinking the young man is dead, a curious fisherman with a scalpel finds two bullets in his back and a miniature laser device in his hip. The laser reveals a Swiss bank account number. But our wet hero isn\'t dead, and soon finds himself in Zurich. In the bank vault the young man discovers his name, Jason Bourne. In addition, he finds a baffling pile of different passports, all with his picture, and a huge pile of cash. In the U.S. Embassy, Jason Bourne discovers his love interest and travel partner, Marie, along with the fact that someone wants to kill him. Armed with a bag of money and mysterious martial arts skills, with Marie by his side, Bourne scours Paris for clues about his identity and past life... and finds himself in the middle of two assassination plots masterminded by the CIA.\r\n-\r\nJoshua Bess', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-04-30', '', '2020-04-09 04:38:35', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::14\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::14A\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::14\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::15\r\nItaly::T\r\nMalaysia::18SG\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13', 12),

When Gandalf discovers the Ring is in fact the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron, Frodo must make an epic quest to the Cracks of Doom in order to destroy it. However, he does not go alone. He is joined by Gandalf, Legolas the elf, Gimli the Dwarf, Aragorn, Boromir, and his three Hobbit friends Merry, Pippin, and Samwise. Through mountains, snow, darkness, forests, rivers and plains, facing evil and danger at every corner the Fellowship of the Ring must go. Their quest to destroy the One Ring is the only hope for the end of the Dark Lords reign.\r\n-\r\nPaul Twomey\r\n\r\nThe future of civilization rests in the fate of the One Ring, which has been lost for centuries. Powerful forces are unrelenting in their search for it. But fate has placed it in the hands of a young Hobbit named Frodo Baggins, who inherits the Ring and steps into legend. A daunting task lies ahead for Frodo when he becomes the Ringbearer, to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom where it was forged.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nThe power of Bilbo Baggins\' ring of invisibility may have been underestimated, Gandalf the Grey fears its power even with his unfathomable magical abilities. As the power of the one Ring grows, so too do the armies of Sauron and Sarumon as their evil spreads across the lands of man, dwarf, and elf alike. It is up to a ragtag band of heroes to carry the ring to Mount Doom, the evil place of its birth, and cast it into the eternal fires that forged it. Does the fellowship have what it takes to complete its task, or will the powers of evil overcome those of good leaving behind a world ravaged by the rage of Sauron, the Dark Lord?\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan\r\n\r\nIn ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, the Dark Lord, forged the One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But the One Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, still it remained lost to him. After many ages it fell, by chance, into the hands of the Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins. On his eleventy-first birthday, Bilbo disappeared, bequeathing to his young nephew, Frodo, the Ruling Ring, and a perilous quest: to journey across Middle-earth, deep into the shadow of the Dark Lord and destroy the Ring by casting it into the Cracks of Doom.\r\n-\r\nThe Tolkien Society\r\n\r\nIn ancient times, the Elven-smiths created the Rings of Power. Then the Dark Lord Sauron created a Ring to rule the Lesser Rings. But the Ring was stolen, and for a long time, he thought it to be lost. But many years later, the Ring came to the hobbit, Bilbo Baggins. In a land called the Shire, Frodo inherits the Ring from his uncle, Bilbo.

Frodo and Sam discover they are being followed by the mysterious Gollum. Aragorn, the Elf archer Legolas, and Gimli the Dwarf encounter the besieged Rohan kingdom, whose once great King Theoden has fallen under Saruman\'s deadly spell.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nThe Fellowship is torn apart. Sauron\'s power is growing stronger. While venturing on to Mordor, Frodo and Sam come across the grotesque creature Gollum, who is forever consumed by the Ring\'s power. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas and Gimli meet up with new allies in the Plains of Rohan. Together, they must work to defend the people of Rohan against Sauron\'s puppet Saruman as he unleashes his armies from Isengard. All the while, Sauron prepares to launch an attack on Gondor. The War for the Ring begins here.\r\n-\r\nBlazer346\r\n\r\nSauron\'s forces increase. His allies grow. The Ringwraiths return in an even more frightening form. Saruman\'s army of Uruk-hai is ready to launch an assault against Aragorn and the people of Rohan. Yet, the Fellowship is broken and Boromir is dead. For the little hope that is left, Frodo and Sam march on into Mordor, unprotected. Several new allies join with Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, Pippin, and Merry, and they must defend Rohan and attack Isengard. Yet, while all this is going on, Sauron\'s troops mass toward Gondor, for the War of the Ring is about to begin.\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan\r\n\r\nThe Fellowship has been broken. Boromir is dead, Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee have gone to Mordor alone to destroy the One Ring, Merry and Pippin have been captured by the Uruk-hai, and Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli have made friends of the Rohan, a race of humans that are in the path of the upcoming war, led by its aging King, ThÃ©oden. The two towers between Mordor and Isengard, Barad-dÃ»r and Orthanc, have united in their lust for destruction. The corrupt wizard Saruman, under the power of the Dark Lord Sauron, and his slimy assistant, GrÃ­ma Wormtongue, have created a grand Uruk-hai army bent on the destruction of Man and Middle-earth. The rebellion against Sauron is building up and will be led by Gandalf the White, who was thought to be dead after the Balrog captured him. One of the Ring\'s original bearers, the creature Gollum, has tracked Frodo and Sam down in search of his \"precious\", but is captured by the Hobbits and used as a way to lead them to Mt. Doom. The War of the Ring has now begun.\r\n-\r\nWill\r\n\r\nFrodo and Sam take Gollum prisoner and continue on to Mordor on the mission to destroy The One Ring.

All the while a growing Shadow falls upon Middle-earth as the Dark Lord\'s Army marches on to Gondor.

Frodo and Sam reach Mordor in their quest to destroy the One Ring, while Aragorn leads the forces of good against Sauron\'s evil army at the stone city of Minas Tirith.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nSauron\'s forces have laid siege to Minas Tirith, the capital of Gondor, in their efforts to eliminate the race of men. The once-great kingdom, watched over by a fading Steward, has never been in more desperate need of its King. But can Aragorn answer the call of his heritage and become what he was born to be? In no small measure, the fate of Middle-earth rests on his broad shoulders. With the final battle joined, and the legions of darkness gathering, Gandalf urgently tries to rally Gondor\'s broken army to action. He is aided by Rohan\'s King Theoden, who unites his warriors for history\'s biggest test. Yet even with their courage and passionate loyalty, the forces of men, with Eowyn and Merry hidden amongst them, are no match for the enemies swarming against Gondor. Still, in the face of great losses, they charge forward into the battle of their lifetimes, tied together by their singular goal to keep Sauron distracted and give the Ring Bearer a chance to complete his quest. Their hopes rest with Frodo, a tiny but determined Hobbit making a perilous trip across treacherous enemy lands to cast the One Ring into the fires of Mount Doom. The closer Frodo gets to his destination, the heavier his burden becomes, and the more he must rely on Samwise Gamgee. Gollum, and the Ring, will test Frodo\'s allegiances and, ultimately, his humanity.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nGondor is overrun by the orcs of Mordor, and Gandalf rides to Minas Tirith to aid the humans in the war that is ahead. Aragorn must realize his true identity and purpose as the King of Men, and journey with Gimli and Legolas to summon the Army of the Dead so that the battle against evil can be won. Meanwhile, paranoia and suspicion rises between Frodo, Sam, and Gollum as they continue their increasingly dark and dangerous travel to Mount Doom, the one place where the One Ring can be destroyed once and for all.\r\n-\r\nQrrbirbel\r\n\r\nThe Fellowship divides to conquer as Frodo and Sam, with the help and hindrance of Gollum, continue their way to Mount Doom. Gandalf and Pippin ride to Minas Tirith to help defend Gondor while Merry remains with Ãowyn and the other Rohan fighters. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli seek aid from those that live in the Cursed Mountains. All of these battles have one goal in mind: distract the Eye of Sauron and buy Frodo a little more time to destroy the One Ring.\r\n-\r\nPompeyV\r\n\r\nThe War of the Ring reaches its climax as the Dark Lord Sauron sets his sights on Minas Tirith, the capital of Gondor. The members of the Fellowship in Rohan are warned of the impending attack when Pippin cannot resist looking into Saruman\'s palantÃ­r and is briefly contacted by the Dark Lord. King ThÃ©oden is too proud to send his men to help without being asked, so Gandalf and Pippin ride to Minas Tirith to see that this request is sent. They meet opposition there from Denethor, Steward of the city and father of Faramir and the late Boromir. Denethor\'s family has acted as temporary guardians of Gondor for centuries until a member of the true line of Kings returns. This member is none other than Aragorn, who must overcome his own self-doubt before he can take on the role he was destined to fulfill. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam continue to carry the One Ring towards Mordor, guided by Gollum. What they don\'t know is that Gollum is leading them into a trap so that he can reclaim the Ring for himself. Though Sam suspects his deceit, Frodo is starting to be corrupted by the Ring\'s power and the mistrust of Sam this causes is fully exploited by Gollum. The only way good can prevail in this contest is if the Ring is destroyed, an event that is becoming harder every minute for Frodo to achieve. The fate of every living creature in Middle-earth will be decided once and for all as the Quest of the Ringbearer reaches its climax.\r\n-\r\nrmlohner', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-04-08', '', '2020-04-08 11:59:36', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4QWnXRUd3k', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 1, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::G\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-11\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-13\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::14\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::16\r\nIreland::12\r\nIsrael::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG-12\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::12\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::11\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13', 13),

Before his death, the Emperor chooses Maximus to be his heir over his own son, Commodus, and a power struggle leaves Maximus and his family condemned to death. The powerful general is unable to save his family, and his loss of will allows him to get captured and put into the Gladiator games until he dies. The only desire that fuels him now is the chance to rise to the top so that he will be able to look into the eyes of the man who will feel his revenge.\r\n-\r\nChris \"Morphy\" Terry\r\n\r\nCommodus takes power and strips rank from Maximus, one of the favored generals of his predecessor and father, Emperor Marcus Aurelius, the great stoical philosopher. Maximus is then relegated to fighting to the death in the gladiator arenas.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nIn 180 A.D. Rome, the weary and dying emperor, Marcus Aurelius, names his loyal and triumphant general, Maximus Decimus Meridius, his successor and protector of Rome, much to the dismay of his haughty and unbalanced son, Commodus. But, instead, death and entrapment await, as the embittered and blind with rage rival rewards Rome\'s hero with an order for his execution, only to wind up as a slave to the former gladiator, Proximo. From the vast deserts of North Africa, a new Maximo will rise as a gladiator, hacking and slashing his way through all the way up to Mother Rome and the unsuspecting dictator, Commodus. But will the popular general ever find peace in a long-awaited retribution?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nIn Gladiator, victorious general Maximus Decimus Meridias has been named keeper of Rome and its empire by dying emperor Marcus Aurelius, so that rule might pass from the Caesars back to the people and Senate. Marcus\' neglected and power-hungry son, Commodus, has other ideas, however. Escaping an ordered execution, Maximus hurries back to his home in Spain, too late to save his wife and son from the same order. Taken into slavery and trained as a gladiator by Proximo, Maximus lives only that he might someday take his revenge and fulfill the dying wish of his emperor. The time soon comes when Proximo\'s troupe is called to Rome to participate in a marathon of gladiator games held at the behest of the new emperor, Commodus. Once in Rome, Maximus wastes no time in making his presence known, and is soon involved in a plot to overthrow the emperor with his former-love Lucilla, Commodus\' sister, after whom he lusts, and also the widowed mother of Lucius, heir to the empire after his uncle, and democratic-minded senator, Gracchus.\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan\r\n\r\nA dying Marcus Aurelius plans to name his loyal and brave General Maximus as his successor in order to restore the power of the Roman Senate. However, his power-hungry, jealous son Commodus learns of the plan, murders Marcus Aurelius, and plans to execute Maximus in order to secure his claim to the throne. Maximus escapes execution, but is sold into slavery and is forced to become a gladiator. Eventually, Maximus and his fellow gladiators are sent to Rome to perform for Commodus. Through his bravery he wins over the masses and reveals his true identity, much to the chagrin of Commodus. Can Maximus use his newfound popularity to avenge Marcus Aurelius\' death, or will Commodus be able to keep the throne?\r\n-', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-04-08', '', '2020-04-08 12:00:43', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhntiTnwcGs', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 1, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::13+\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-15\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::15\r\nIsrael::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::Unrated', 12),

However when he associates himself with Tyler (Brad Pitt) he is dragged into an underground fight club and soap making scheme.

Tyler seems to be everything that he\'s not and together they create a men-only group for bare-knuckle fighting. It soon becomes all the rage with fight clubs springing up across the country and the group itself becoming an anti-capitalist domestic terrorist organization.

Much to his surprise, the formerly depressed loner finds himself deriving pleasure out of pain through bare-knuckle brawls in the Fight Club: an underground society of men who yearn to free themselves from the fetters of a cruel modern life. Now, he is ready to wage war. Are violence and freedom the two sides of the same coin?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nA young urban professional who works for a major car manufacturer can\'t sleep. Although he doesn\'t have any of the associated afflictions, he stumbles across support groups as a means to let out whatever emotions he is feeling, which in turn allows him to sleep. But the use of these support groups is ruined when he meets a young woman named Marla Singer, who is also going to all these support group meetings. Because he knows she too is not afflicted with any of the maladies for which the groups exist, her presence has lessened the impact of the stories he hears. His life changes when he meets a soap manufacturer named Tyler Durden, who in many ways is the antithesis of the insomniac. Due to unusual circumstances with his own condo, the insomniac moves in with Tyler, who lives in a large dilapidated house in an otherwise abandoned part of town. After a bit of spontaneous roughhousing with Tyler in a bar parking lot, the insomniac finds it becomes a ritual between the two of them, which helps him cope with the other more difficult aspects of his life. The fights also attract a following, others who not only want to watch but join in. Understanding that there are other men like them, the insomniac and Tyler begin a secret fight club. As the fight club\'s popularity grows, so does its scope in all aspects. Marla becomes a circle not specifically of the fight clubs but of Tyler and the insomniac\'s collectives lives.

The stately silence of Paris\' Louvre museum is broken when one of the gallery\'s leading curators is found dead on the grounds, with strange symbols carved into his body and left around the spot where he died. Hoping to learn the significance of the symbols, police bring in Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), a gifted cryptographer who is also the victim\'s granddaughter. Needing help, Sophie calls on Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), a leading symbolized from the United States. As Sophie and Robert dig deeper into the case, they discover the victim\'s involvement in the Priory of Sion, a secret society whose members have been privy to forbidden knowledge dating back to the birth of Christianity. In their search, Sophie and Robert happen upon evidence that could lead to the final resting place of the Holy Grail, while members of the priory and an underground Catholic society known as Opus Dei give chase, determined to prevent them from sharing their greatest secrets with the world.\r\n\r\nProfessor Robert Langdon is in Paris on business when he\'s summoned to The Louvre. A dead body has been found, setting Langdon off on an adventure as he attempts to unravel an ancient code and uncover the greatest mystery of all time.\r\n-\r\ncomicfan\r\n\r\nThe story tells the investigation started by symbolist Robert Langdon and a good-looking cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, around the murder of a Museum Louvre\'s curator. In fact, the unfortunate murdered man was Sophie\'s grandfather, and the corpse was found with a series of symbols and codes, like a pentagram and a Fibonacci number sequence. But police detective Fache will begin to chase Langdon, who escapes after receiving a warning about the captain\'s real intentions. Sophie has with her a kind of key with dots and number 24 engraved on it, which opens to her and Langdon a big complex investigation that involves a supposedly heretic theory: Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene were, in fact, a couple who produced a daughter named Sara. A millenarian sect called The Priory of Sion has kept for centuries the secret of that matter. A masochist and kind of psychopath albino monk, Sibilas, an Opus Dei member, will chase Langdon and Sophie as well, in order to impede that they solve the mystery of Christ and Mary Magdalene, and also the real meaning and location of the Holy Grail. A passionate British researcher, will help Langdon in his quest, revealing to them several symbolisms in Da Vinci\'s master work The Last Supper, traveling to mythical places in the U.K., such as The Church Temple, where it is believed that a group of Templars Knights are buried, and Sir Isaac Newton\'s tomb at Westminster Abbey, where are located some of the main keys to solve the Holy Grail\'s mystery.\r\n-\r\nAlejandro Frias\r\n\r\nWhen respected American religious symbology expert Dr. Robert Langdon is summoned to the Louvre by the French version of the F.B.I., led by Captain Bezu Fache, he soon discovered that he is the number one suspect for the murder of a historian Langdon had been scheduled to meet. Assisted by a French cryptographer and government agent named Sophie, Langdon is challenged to decipher a chain of cryptic codes and puzzles, all the while trying to stay ahead of Fache\'s lawmen in a chase through the Louvre, and out into the Parisian cityscape, and finally across the channel to England. Can Langdon and Sophie decipher the nature of a secret dating back to Leonardo Da Vinci and earlier before those responsible for the historian\'s murder add them to their hit list?\r\n-\r\nAustin4577@aol.com\r\n\r\nWhile in Paris on business, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is informed that the elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum. Near the body, police have found a baffling cipher. Solving the enigmatic riddle, Langdon is stunned to discover it leads to a trail of clues hidden in the works of Leonardo Da Vinci, clues visible for all to see, and yet ingeniously disguised by the painter. Langdon joins forces with a gifted French cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, and learns the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion, an actual secret society. In a breathless race through Paris, London and beyond, Langdon and Neveu match wits with a faceless power broker who appears to work for Opus Dei, a clandestine, Vatican-sanctioned Catholic organization believed to have long plotted to seize the Priory\'s secret. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle in time, the Priory\'s secret, and a stunning historical truth, will be lost forever.\r\n-\r\nbondish', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-04-08', '', '2020-04-08 12:05:39', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2whAEEZ8OQ', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChina::(Banned)\r\nDenmark::15\r\nEgypt::(Banned)\r\nFinland::K-15\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::14\r\nIndia::(Banned)\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nMalaysia::18PL\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::15\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::NC-16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUkraine::12\r\nVenezuela::PG-13', 13),

An ominous threat of their hourly demise, along with the complete annihilation of Vatican City, is issued as an elaborate revenge scheme by a persecuted group known as the Illuminati.

Colin Sullivan (played by Matt Damon) is a Massachusetts State police detective. He has risen through the ranks to head up a special department. Public Enemy Number 1 is Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), a crime network kingpin, and Sullivan\'s main target. However, Sullivan is a paid informant for Costello, giving him tip-offs on police raids and other useful information. Meanwhile, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) works for Costello. However, he is actually an undercover policeman, spying on Costello. In due course, both know that there is a rat in their organization, but don\'t know their identity. A deadly cat-and-mouse game ensues, with both trying to uncover the other without being discovered themselves.\r\n-\r\ngrantss\r\n\r\nA war between the police and the mob, but who\'s on the right side? And is there one? A tale of deception, The Departed focuses on a young cop, Billy Costigan who risks his morals, and his sanity to infiltrate an American- Irish mob and gain the trust of its leader - Frank Costello. The plot thickens when both Billy and Costello discover a rat in their disparate organisations, and chaos ensues.\r\n-\r\nBecksyKane\r\n\r\nYears ago, a powerful Irish mafia figure placed a small selection of his youngest, brightest men into the Massachusetts State Police Academy as cadets. Their purpose is to eventually rise within the prestigious ranks of the state police department, to serve as the eyes and ears of their boss. While somewhere else, a young cadet was assigned with an equally dangerous task: infiltrate the Irish syndicate headed by the man sending in his own to the Massachusetts State Police. Now, one cadet is an up and coming police official with a torn allegiance to his job and to the criminal mastermind that put him there. While the other cadet is the trusted number two of that man, only finding his professional duties are becoming blurred with his current state. But new clues have lead to unfortunate discoveries, when both sides realize they\'re being watched by the enemy.\r\n-\r\nmystic80', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-04-30', '', '2020-04-09 04:37:43', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 1, 'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nAustria::16\r\nBrazil::18\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::14\r\nChina::(Banned)\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-15\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-13\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIran::18+\r\nIreland::18\r\nIsrael::16\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nJapan::R-15\r\nMalaysia::18SG\r\nMexico::C\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::18\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRomania::I.C.-14\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::18\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nUnited Kingdom::18\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUkraine::16', 18),

Now his grandfather believes that the forefathers\' buried a treasure somewhere in the country and have placed clues everywhere but unfortunately the clues are highly cryptic and scaterred all over the place. Now Ben thinks he has found it but it only leads him to another clue which is on the back of the Declaration of Independence. Now one of his associates Ian wants to steal it so that they could get the clue but Ben refuses to do it so he tries to kill Ben. But Ben evades him and tries to warn the authorities about Ian\'s plans but they don\'t believe him. So Ben takes it upon himself to steal it in order to protect it. And he does but Abigail Chase the curator of the National Archives, where it is kept, discovers what he has done and tries to stop him but gets caught in the crossfire between Ben and Ian, so Ben takes her with him. While she doesdn\'t believe him, he is determined to prove he is right about the treasure.

Far away from home, his girlfriend, and any human contact, he engages in a battle of wits with himself as he is tested mentally, physically, and emotionally in order to survive.\r\n-\r\nAmthermandes\r\n\r\nMemphis-based FedEx operations executive Chuck Noland and grad student Kelly Frears have long dated and lived together, and despite each being the love of the other\'s life, have not gotten married because of their respective busy schedules, especially Chuck\'s as he is more often on business trips than he is at home. That marital status changes when on Christmas Day 1995 as Chuck is rushing off to catch yet another FedEx plane for a business trip, he gives Kelly a ring. That flight experiences technical difficulties, and goes down somewhere in the south Pacific. In a life raft, a relatively unharmed Chuck washes up on shore what he will learn is a deserted island, he unaware what has happened to any of his fellow flight mates, or the plane. However several of the packages on board for delivery do wash up on shore with him, those packages which he initially treats with respect. Chuck realizes that his priority is survival - which primarily means food, water, shelter and fire - and rescue. But survival is also in an emotional sense. To fulfill that emotional need, he has an heirloom pocket watch with Kelly\'s photo that she gave him as a Christmas present, and eventually opening the FedEx packages, a Wilson volleyball on which he paints a face and which he names Wilson. As time progresses, Chuck goes through a range of emotions, but if rescue is ever in the cards, he realizes that he has to find a way to get off the island, which is seemingly impossible in his circumstance due to the strong on shore surf he cannot get beyond without assistance. What Chuck may not fully realize is the longer he is not rescued, the harder it will be for him to return to his old life in its entirety if he ever is rescued. Although the thought of Kelly is what largely keeps him motivated to be rescued, Kelly, who probably believes him to be dead, may have moved on emotionally from him in the intervening time.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nAfter FedEx systems engineer Chuck Noland is ripped out of his hasty life by the clock in a plane crash, he finds himself alone on the shores of a tropical island. First, frustration gets to him and then he realizes how little his chances are to ever get back to civilization. Four years later, Chuck has learned very well how to survive on his own: mending his dental health, catching fish with a spear, predicting the weather with a self-made calendar. A photograph of his girlfriend Kelly has kept his hopes alive all these years. Finally, Chuck takes the opportunity to take off for home: he sets off on a wooden raft with a sail that has washed ashore.\r\n-\r\nJulian Reischl\r\n\r\nChuck Noland is a FedEx manager who demands that everything must be on time and travels the world to make sure punctuality is on top of everything else. He has a girlfriend, Kelly, with whom he is deeply in love with and family he hardly sees. When work intrudes on Christmas Eve, Chuck has a quick gift exchange in the car and kisses Kelly goodbye. He boards a delivery plane going overseas which gets caught in a horrendous storm and crashes into the Pacific. The sole survivor Chuck washes up on a remote island along with several FedEx packages that he must use for supplies. With limited luxury, he adapts to the island over the course of 1,500 nights. When Chuck finally sees his chance he rafts out on the ocean and fortunately is spotted. After a bittersweet welcome-back reception, Chuck finds Kelly has married another man and has children. But he is missing more than her. For all his life his objective was work. For four years, it was survival. Now Chuck is compelled to live.\r\n-\r\nDonnel Hoffman\r\n\r\nChuck, a top international manager for FedEx, and Kelly, a Ph.D. student, are in love and heading towards marriage. Then Chuck\'s plane to Malaysia ditches at sea during a terrible storm. He\'s the only survivor, and he washes up on a tiny island with nothing but some flotsam and jetsam from the aircraft\'s cargo. Can he survive in this tropical wasteland? Will he ever return to woman he loves?\r\n-\r\nMartin Lewison', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-04-30', '', '2020-04-08 12:24:23', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNHRbnONjCU', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 1, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::PG\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nIceland::L\r\nIndia::UA\r\nItaly::T\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::11\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::T\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUkraine::12', 12),

Pictures, but mostly focusing on his role in designing and promoting new aircraft. Hughes was a risk-taker spending several fortunes on designing experimental aircraft and eventually founding TWA as a rival to Pan Am airlines owned by his great rival Juan Trippe. When Trippe\'s politico Senator Ralph Owen Brewster accuses Hughes of being a war profiteer, it\'s Hughes who gains the upper hand. Hughes also had many women in his life including a long relationship with Katharine Hepburn. From an early age, however, Hughes was also germophobic and would have severe bouts of mental illness.\r\n-\r\nHoward Hughes\r\n\r\nBillionaire and aviation tycoon Howard Hughes is a successful public figure: a director of big-budget Hollywood movies such as \"Hell\'s Angels (1930)\", a passionate lover of Hollywood\'s leading ladies Katharine Hepburn and Ava Gardner, and an aviation pioneer who helps build TWA into a major airline. But in private, Hughes remains tormented, suffering from paralyzing phobias and depression. The higher he rises, the farther has to fall.\r\n-\r\nHoward Hughes\r\n\r\nTexan oil fortune heir Howard Hughes refuses to wisely invest and enjoy his millions, preferring to riskily spend on his passions: airplanes and Hollywood, so in the 1930s he produces an unprecedented air combat blockbuster Hell Angels which he keeps improving to staff\'s despair, with Katherine Hepburn as bonus lover. He moves on to improving airplane design and running airline TWA, the sole US-overseas challenger for PanAm. His germophobia gets utterly out of hand and test-piloting himself nearly breaks every bone is his body, but the worst challenge comes from senator Ralph Owen Brewster, who uses the FBI to threaten Hughes with ruin and public exposure as \'war profiteer\' unless he accepts personal friend Juan Trippe\'s company PanAm being given a virtual monopoly on international flights.\r\n-\r\nKGF Vissers\r\n\r\nThe script begins as a young Hughes directs one of Director Martin Scorsese\'s favorite movies, Hell\'s Angels (1930). Hughes was so obsessed with perfection in the aerial sequences that he waits forever for perfect conditions, right down to cloud formations. This movie ends in 1946, when Hughes was still a dashing young man and romancing actresses like Ava Gardner and Katharine Hepburn.\r\n-\r\nHell\'s Angels (1930)\r\n\r\nPhenomenal public success contrasts with private behaviors close to madness: Howard Hughes from the late 1920s to the late 1940s, from \"Hell\'s Angels (1930)\" (spending a fortune on details) through the only flight of the Hercules, a huge, money-losing transport plane. Along the way, the public Hughes sees the big picture, in movies and in aviation, building TWA and leading it through a fight with Pan Am and the U.S. Senate. In private, phobias and compulsions threaten him with self-imposed solitary confinement. How long can his imagination, drive, and the sympathies of Katharine Hepburn, Ava Gardner, and the men who work for him stave off these internal disorders?\r\n-\r\nHoward Hughes\r\n\r\nFocusing on his early years (from the 1930 production of Hell\'s Angels (1930), to the 1947 test flight of the Spruce Goose, when he was forty-two), this is the story of how young Howard Hughes transformed a small fortune into a massive one. The son of the Texan inventor of an amazing drill bit who died when he was eighteen, leaving him with seventy-five percent of the \"Hughes Tool Co.\", Howard Hughes quickly moved to Los Angeles to become a Hollywood movie producer, where he helped launch the career of Jean Harlow and other starlets, and producing such classics as Hell\'s Angels (1930), The Front Page (1931), Flying Leathernecks (1951), and Scarface: The Shame of the Nation (1932), eventually owning R.K.O. Pictures. Hughes\' legend came not from focusing on just Hollywood, however, as he simultaneously branched into industry after industry, including aviation in 1932 (including TWA Airlines), and during World War II, defense, leading to the creation of the Spruce Goose, a flying boat of immense size. After World War II, Hughes\' expansions continued, with an electronics company that was integral to the evolution of the satellite, and Hughes\' several Las Vegas casinos (though this movie may be ending before he moves there). This movie also focuses on Hughes\' romances with Hollywood stars like Katharine Hepburn and Ava Gardner.\r\n-\r\nHell\'s Angels (1930)', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-04-30', '', '2020-04-08 12:25:24', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-xGf2Fs-0', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 1, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE\r\nCzech Republic::15\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-11\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::D\r\nIreland::12\r\nItaly::T\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::11\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUkraine::12', 12),

Entrusted with retrieving a glow-emitting leather suitcase which belongs to their boss--the powerful crime kingpin, Marsellus--instead, the dark-suited gunmen, Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield, end up with a bloody mess. Fortunately--with men like Mr Wolf always around to handle a crisis--there\'s time to cool off in a long twist contest, while at the same time, the proud champion boxer, Butch, makes the decision of a lifetime.

After spending the cold day on the beach, he meets Clementine Kruczynski on the train station and they have a crush on each other. Joel and Clementine do not know that they were mates in the past. Joel has just erased Clementine from his memories when he found that Clementine did exactly the same, when their relationship ended. However, along his erasing process, Joel becomes astonished when he finds that he still loves Clementine and he does not want to lose her, fighting for keeping the memories of their moments together instead.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nThis is the story of a guy, Joel, who discovers that his long-time girlfriend, Clementine, has undergone a psychiatrist\'s experimental procedure in which all of her memory of Joel is removed, after the couple has tried for years to get their relationship working fluidly. Frustrated by the idea of still being in love with a woman who doesn\'t remember their time together, Joel agrees to undergo the procedure as well, to erase his memories of Clementine. The film, which takes place mostly within Joel\'s mind, follows his memories of Clementine backwards in time as each recent memory is replaced, and the procedure then goes on to the previous one, which is likewise seen, and then erased. Once the process starts, however, Joel realizes he doesn\'t really want to forget Clementine, so he starts smuggling her away into parts of his memory where she doesn\'t belong which alters other things about his memories as well...\r\n-\r\naustin4577@aol.com', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-04-30', '', '2020-04-08 12:28:54', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7IzQmGnGoM', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 1, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nFinland::K-11\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nIceland::L\r\nIndia::UA\r\nItaly::T\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::AL\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::11\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::NC-16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R', 12),

Mesmerized with trinkets of Earth\'s history and show tunes, WALL-E is alone on Earth except for a sprightly pet cockroach. One day, EVE, a sleek (and dangerous) reconnaissance robot, is sent to Earth to find proof that life is once again sustainable. WALL-E falls in love with EVE. WALL-E rescues EVE from a dust storm and shows her a living plant he found amongst the rubble. Consistent with her \"directive\", EVE takes the plant and automatically enters a deactivated state except for a blinking green beacon. WALL-E, doesn\'t understand what has happened to his new friend, but, true to his love, he protects her from wind, rain, and lightning, even as she is unresponsive. One day a massive ship comes to reclaim EVE, but WALL-E, out of love or loneliness, hitches a ride on the outside of the ship to rescue EVE. The ship arrives back at a large space cruise ship, which is carrying all of the humans who evacuated Earth 700 years earlier. The people of Earth ride around this space resort on hovering chairs which give them a constant feed of TV and video chatting. They drink all of their meals through a straw out of laziness and/or bone loss, and are all so fat that they can barely move. When the auto-pilot computer, acting on hastily-given instructions sent many centuries before, tries to prevent the people of Earth from returning by stealing the plant, WALL-E, EVE, the portly captain, and a band of broken robots stage a mutiny.\r\n\r\nIn the distant future, humans abandon Earth because there is too much trash on it. WALL-E, with habit of picking up everything he finds interesting, lives alone on the planet with a pet cockroach. He has quite a collection of things, from lighters to a working iPod and even a small ring box (without the ring). He even has the last living plant. When a spaceship comes to earth and drops a sleek and dangerous probe EVE to look for a living plant, WALL-E falls in love with her. WALL-E gives her the plant, which makes EVE go into sleep mode. When a spaceship comes to take EVE back, WALL-E too goes with her. What follows is an adventure onboard the Axiom, where people move on hovering chairs and get liquid food which they suck up through a straw. Due to laziness, they have become so fat that they are unable to move. Due to hastily given instructions given to it, auto, the autopilot it tries to get rid of the plant which compels WALL-E, EVE, the pilot and some malfunctioning robots to find a way to retrieve the plant and save the earth.\r\n-\r\nsrijanarora-152-448595\r\n\r\nWALL-E, short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class, is the last robot left on Earth. He spends his days tidying up the planet, one piece of garbage at a time. But during 700 years, WALL-E has developed a personality, and he\'s more than a little lonely. Then he spots EVE, a sleek and shapely probe sent back to Earth on a scanning mission. Smitten WALL-E embarks on his greatest adventure yet when he follows EVE across the galaxy.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nIt\'s late in the third millennium, and Earth has become an uninhabitable wasteland with nothing able to grow. Several hundred years earlier, a corporation called Buy-N-Large shipped all humans off the planet to live on starships, they biding their time until Earth is able to regenerate itself into an inhabitable planet. They also left WALLÂ·E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter: Earth-Class) robots on Earth to clean up and compact all the industrial waste. Only one WALLÂ·E remains, it which has gained emotions and the ability to feel. In order to survive emotionally, WALLÂ·E uses whatever it can find as touchstones to past life on Earth. Despite their initial antagonistic encounter, WALLÂ·E befriends an EVE (Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator), a droid sent from the mother ship, Axiom, as a sensor to gauge if life has regenerated on Earth. Not knowing about EVE\'s mission, WALLÂ·E is surprised by EVE\'s interest in a small seedling WALLÂ·E previously found and brought back to its makeshift abode. In EVE needing to take the seedling back to Axiom, WALLÂ·E, not wanting to lose its new friend, hitches a ride as a stowaway to Axiom. A combination of WALLÂ·E making it back to Axiom and EVE bringing back the seedling leads to a risk to both their survival, as AUTO, the automated pilot manning Axiom, has its own agenda against the recolonization of Earth.\r\n-\r\nHuggo', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-04-30', '', '2020-04-08 12:30:37', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbF6wxmxwBo', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::G\r\nAustria::0\r\nBrazil::Livre\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE\r\nCzech Republic::U\r\nDenmark::7\r\nFinland::K-3\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::0\r\nGreece::K\r\nHong Kong::I\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::L\r\nIndia::U\r\nIreland::G\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::V\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMalta::U\r\nMexico::AA\r\nNetherlands::AL\r\nNew Zealand::G\r\nNorway::7\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::G\r\nPortugal::M/6\r\nRussia::0+\r\nSingapore::G\r\nSouth Africa::A\r\nSouth Korea::All\r\nSpain::T\r\nSweden::Btl\r\nSwitzerland::0\r\nTaiwan::GP\r\nUnited Kingdom::U\r\nUnited States::G', 0),

Their company quickly grows from a staff of 20 to a staff of more than 250 and their status in the trading community and Wall Street grows exponentially. So much that companies file their initial public offerings through them. As their status grows, so do the amount of substances they abuse, and so do their lies. They draw attention like no other, throwing lavish parties for their staff when they hit the jackpot on high trades. That ultimately leads to Belfort featured on the cover of Forbes Magazine, being called \"The Wolf Of Wall St.\". With the FBI onto Belfort\'s trading schemes, he devises new ways to cover his tracks and watch his fortune grow. Belfort ultimately comes up with a scheme to stash their cash in a European bank. But with the FBI watching him like a hawk, how long will Belfort and Azoff be able to maintain their elaborate wealth and luxurious lifestyles?\r\n-\r\nhalo1k\r\n\r\nIn 1987, Jordan Belfort procures a job as a Wall Street stockbroker for L.F. Rothschild, employed under Mark Hanna, who quickly entices him with the sex and drugs fueled stockbroker culture and passes on his idea that a stockbroker\'s only goal is to make money for himself. Jordan soon finds his career terminated following Black Monday and takes a job at a boiler room brokerage firm on Long Island that specializes in penny stocks. Thanks to his aggressive pitching style and the high commissions, Jordan makes a small fortune. Jordan befriends his neighbor, Donnie Azoff, and the two found their own company. They recruit several of Jordan\'s friends, whom Jordan trains in the art of the \"hard sell\". The basic method of the firm is a pump and dump scam. To cloak this, Jordan gives the firm the respectable-sounding name of Stratton Oakmont. After an expose in Forbes, hundreds of ambitious young financiers flock to his company. Jordan becomes immensely successful and slides into a decadent lifestyle of prostitutes and drugs. He has an affair with a woman named Naomi Lapaglia..', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-04-30', '', '2020-04-08 12:31:21', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb_UJ3bHiVI', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 1, 'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nBrazil::18\r\nCanada::16+\r\nCzech Republic::15\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nHong Kong::III\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::21+\r\nIreland::18\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nJapan::R15+\r\nLithuania::N-16\r\nMalaysia::(Banned)\r\nMexico::C\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R18\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::R-16\r\nPoland::18\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRomania::I.M.-18\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Africa::18\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nTaiwan::R-18\r\nThailand::18\r\nTurkey::18+\r\nUnited Kingdom::18\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUkraine::18', 18),

After graduation, she aspires to work in the agency\'s Behavioral Science Unit under the leadership of Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn). While she is still a trainee, Crawford asks her to question Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Sir Anthony Hopkins), a psychiatrist imprisoned, thus far, for eight years in maximum security isolation for being a serial killer who cannibalized his victims. Clarice is able to figure out the assignment is to pick Lecter\'s brains to help them solve another serial murder case, that of someone coined by the media as \"Buffalo Bill\" (Ted Levine), who has so far killed five victims, all located in the eastern U.S., all young women, who are slightly overweight (especially around the hips), all who were drowned in natural bodies of water, and all who were stripped of large swaths of skin. She also figures that Crawford chose her, as a woman, to be able to trigger some emotional response from Lecter. After speaking to Lecter for the first time, she realizes that everything with him will be a psychological game, with her often having to read between the very cryptic lines he provides. She has to decide how much she will play along, as his request in return for talking to him is to expose herself emotionally to him. The case takes a more dire turn when a sixth victim is discovered, this one from who they are able to retrieve a key piece of evidence, if Lecter is being forthright as to its meaning. A potential seventh victim is high profile Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith), the daughter of Senator Ruth Martin (Diane Baker), which places greater scrutiny on the case as they search for a hopefully still alive Catherine. Who may factor into what happens is Dr. Frederick Chilton (Anthony Heald), the warden at the prison, an opportunist who sees the higher profile with Catherine, meaning a higher profile for himself if he can insert himself successfully into the proceedings.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nPerplexed by a string of grisly murders elaborately executed by the elusive mass-killer nicknamed \"Buffalo Bill\", the vulnerable and untried F.B.I. trainee, Clarice Starling, is assigned by the Special Agent, Jack Crawford, to assist in the manhunt. Hoping to attain a clearer perception of the psychopathic serial killer\'s modus operandi, the young investigator reluctantly accepts the help of another hideous monster: the brilliant psychiatrist and cannibalistic mass-murderer, Dr Hannibal Lecter. Now, with every visit to the manipulative doctor\'s heavily reinforced prison cell, Clarice delves just a little bit deeper into the dark mind of a homicidal maniac; however, how far is she willing to go to unearth pure evil?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nYoung F.B.I. trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is assigned to help find a missing woman to save her from a psychopathic serial killer (Ted Levine) who skins his victims. Clarice attempts to gain a better insight into the twisted mind of the killer by talking to another psychopath: Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Sir Anthony Hopkins), who used to be a respected psychiatrist. F.B.I. Special Agent Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) believes that Lecter, who is also a very powerful and clever mind manipulator, has the answers to their questions and can help locate the killer. However, Clarice must first gain Lecter\'s confidence before the inmate will give away any information.\r\n-\r\nSami Al-Taher\r\n\r\nClarice Starling (Jodie Foster), a young intelligent F.B.I. trainee, has been sent to the Baltimore state hospital for the criminally insane to interview an inmate, Dr. Hannibal \"the cannibal\" Lecter (Sir Anthony Hopkins), a brilliant renowned psychiatrist turned infamous psychopathic serial killer. She must match wits with Lecter, who has the darkest of all minds, and trust him to give her clues in the search for \"Buffalo Bill\" (Ted Levine), a nickname given to a loose, unknown, unstoppable psychopathic serial killer.\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan\r\n\r\nA psychopath known as \"Buffalo Bill\" (Ted Levine) is kidnapping and murdering young women across the Midwest. Believing it takes one to know one, the F.B.I. sends trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) to interview a demented prisoner who may provide psychological insight and clues to the killer\'s actions. The prisoner is psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Sir Anthony Hopkins), a brilliant, murderous cannibal who will only help Starling if she feeds his morbid curiosity with details of her own complicated life. This twisted relationship forces Starling to not only confront her psychological demons, but leads her face to face with a demented, heinous killer; an incarnation of evil so powerful, that she may not have the courage, or strength, to stop him.\r\n-\r\nRobert Lynch', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-04-30', '', '2020-04-09 04:30:29', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 1, 'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::16+\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-18\r\nFrance::16\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-15\r\nHong Kong::III\r\nHungary::18\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIreland::18\r\nIsrael::18\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nLithuania::N-16\r\nMalaysia::(Banned)\r\nMexico::C\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::18\r\nPhilippines::R-18\r\nPoland::15\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::18\r\nSweden::15\r\nUnited Kingdom::18\r\nUnited States::R', 18),

Unfortunately, SkyNet does send another one back - and this one is called the T-X, even more powerful & advanced than the dreaded T-1000. However, another CSM-101 Terminator is also sent back to protect John against the T-X. Now, Skynet is patiently assuming control of civilian computer systems, under the guise of a computer virus. John has also met his future wife, Kate Brewster, whose father - a U.S. Air Force General - is in charge of the military computer systems & is leery of up linking SkyNet. However, when the SkyNet virus infects the U.S military computers & leaves the country open to attack, the machines begin their horrific takeover. Soon a nuclear war will result - and the war against the machines will begin. Can the outdated CSM-101 Terminator eliminate the highly advanced T-X - or will a darker future await man following the nuclear attack?\r\n-\r\nDerek O\'Cain\r\n\r\nLiving off-grid--ten long and challenging years after the encounter with the liquid-metal killer in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)--the resilient survivor and now-23-year-old vagabond, John Connor, knows that these are dark and uncertain times. For the third time, the self-aware computer network, Skynet, sends another cyborg assassin--this time, its most efficient and technologically perfect model, the gynoid-like T-X--to terminate the future leader of the humans; however, the Resistance, too, has sent a protector: the reprogrammed but long-obsolete, T-101. Once more, the future is hanging by a thread, and this time, it\'s either us or the cold robots. Is humankind prepared for the Rise of the Machines?\r\n-\r\nTerminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)\r\n\r\nIt is a dark time for the resistance and Skynet is on the verge of going online, the events of the last movie has changed nothing and John must now battle a new Terminator called the T-X. As before, the resistance was able to send another T-800 as a protector for John, and its still a question of which one will reach him first...\r\n-\r\nScott\r\n\r\nOn the verge of Judgement Day, the most advanced Terminator unit ever, the T-X, arrives from the future to ensure the rise of the machines. The only hope against it is a new upgraded T-800 unit, the T-850, that is sent back by the human resistance. Together with John Connor, it must stop the rise of the machines or all humanity will fall.\r\n-\r\nPaul McLaughlin\r\n\r\nJohn Conner, now an adult, in fear of the events that took place at a young age, lives off the grid--no phone, no job, no credit cards. After failing twice, SkyNet sends their most advanced machine to date, the T-X or Terminatrix, to not only kill John, but his future wife as well. Once again, a Terminator is sent to protect John and his future wife, and has a small upgrade which allows it to mimick humans more. Not knowing how these terminators were sent, considering he thought he destroyed SkyNet, John will soon learn something that will change his life...forever.\r\n-\r\nHayden', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-04-30', '', '2020-04-09 04:32:18', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::13+\r\nCzech Republic::U\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-15\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::12\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG-12\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::15\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::R', 12),

In 2018, after an unsuccessful attack to a Skynet facility, only John Connor survives, but he discovers that Skynet is developing the powerful new model T-800. Out of the blue, Marcus appears naked and with amnesia in the location. Marcus befriends the teenager Kyle Reese and the girl Star who help him to survive the lethal machines and they travel together in a Jeep. Meanwhile the resistance discovers a signal that might turn-off the machines and John offers to test it. When Kyle is captured by a machine and brought to the Skynet headquarters, Marcus decides to help the youngster and heads to Skynet; on the way, he saves Blair Williams who suggests to him that he should meet John Connor first. But Marcus steps on a mine and is submitted to surgery, when a secret about his origins is disclosed.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nIn 2018, Skynet has destroyed most of humanity and survivors have been hiding underground from an army of machines, known as \"Terminators\". After a failed attack on a Skynet base, John Connor, the man fated to lead the Resistance is the sole survivor. On the other hand, Marcus Wright, who only remembers being on death row, meets Kyle Reese and it is believed by Connor that he was sent from the future to kill him. Now Marcus and John must unlikely join forces in order to save Kyle Reese and the humans captured by the machines.\r\n-\r\nEmphinix\r\n\r\nIn the not too distant future, John Connor is a key member of the resistance against the machines that have taken over the Earth. From the recordings his mother has left him, he knows he has to find Kyle Reese and send him back to Earth if the future is to occur as it should. Reese is just a teenager now, on the run like many other humans. While in the company of another survivor, Marcus Wright, Kyle is taken prisoner by the machines and transported to Skynet\'s headquarters in San Francisco. Connor sets out to rescue him but is shocked by Wright\'s true nature. Not all is at it seems to be and success is far from guaranteed.\r\n-\r\ngarykmcd\r\n\r\nIn a grim 2018--in the wake of Skynet\'s devastating Judgment Day that claimed the lives of billions in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003)--the original leader of the Resistance, General Hugh Ashdown, and a now-grown-up John Connor call for a united effort to save the remaining survivors and destroy the self-aware machine network in San Francisco. Now, more than ever, protecting the sixteen-year-old version of Sergeant Kyle Reese becomes the war\'s priority; however, things are further complicated by the arrival of the enigmatic human with the pale memories of death row, Marcus Wright. More and more, as Skynet deploys an army of relentless machines to terminate John and Kyle, humankind\'s salvation lies in the hands of a single rescue team. Is all hope lost?\r\n-\r\nTerminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003)\r\n\r\nSet in post-apocalyptic 2018, John Connor is the man fated to lead the human resistance against Skynet and its army of Terminators.

Connor must decide whether Marcus has been sent from the future, or rescued from the past. As Skynet prepares its final onslaught, Connor and Marcus both embark on an odyssey that takes them into the heart of Skynet\'s operations, where they uncover the terrible secret behind the possible annihilation of mankind.\r\n-\r\nWarner Bros.

They intercepted the terminator he followed and plan to use it\'s chip to activate a time machine they built to go to 1997 which is when Skynet was activated but Reese says they should not go to 1997 but to 2017. He says that there\'s a voice or memory that tells him to remember the date because it\'s when they can stop Skynet. So Sarah and Reese go, the terminator stays behind and says he\'ll meet them when they arrive but they get arrested when they arrive and someone unexpected show up.\r\n-\r\nrcs0411@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nIt is 2029. Since 1997 humans have been engaged in a life-or-death struggle with the robots of Skynet. One of the leaders of the human forces is John Connor. He sends Kyle Reese back to 1984 to protect his mother, Sarah Connor. Upon arriving in 1984 he discovers that Sarah Connor already has a protector, a largely-obsolete robot / Terminator. However, Skynet has also sent back a Terminator.\r\n-\r\ngrantss\r\n\r\nOn the brink of ending the War against the Machines--more than three decades after the nuclear Armageddon in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)--John Connor sends his right-hand man, Lieutenant Kyle Reese, to 1984 Los Angeles. Entrusted with protecting Sarah Connor, the most important woman on Earth, instead, Reese finds himself in a radically altered timeline after an unforeseen complication in 2029. Now, Sarah has a reprogrammed T-800 Terminator by her side, planning to travel forward in time, in 2017 San Francisco, to prevent the self-aware computer network from going online. First, humankind\'s arch-enemy was Skynet. This time, it is Cyberdyne\'s operating system, Genisys.

Once more, the self-aware computer system sends back in time its most sophisticated android assassin--the nearly indestructible terminator made of advanced mimetic poly-alloy, Rev-9--to exterminate young Dani in 2020 Mexico City. However, from the distant 2042, a fearless protector arrives--the bionically enhanced Resistance fighter, Grace--who, to ensure Dani\'s survival, reluctantly joins forces with an unexpected ally, and a battle-tested defender from the past: the armed-to-the-teeth, Sarah Connor.

In a fury of blogging and programming, what begins in his dorm room soon becomes a global social network and a revolution in communication. A mere six years and 500 million friends later, Mark Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire in history... but for this entrepreneur, success leads to both personal and legal complications.\r\n-\r\nColumbia Pictures\r\n\r\nEvery age has its visionaries who leave, in the wake of their genius, a changed world--but rarely without a battle over exactly what happened and who was there at the moment of creation. \"The Social Network\" explores the moment at which Facebook was invented--through the warring perspectives of the super-smart young men who each claimed to be there at its inception. The movie moves from the halls of Harvard to the cubicles of Palo Alto to capture the heady early days of a culture-changing phenomenon in the making--and the way it both pulled a group of young revolutionaries together and then split them apart. In the midst of the chaos are Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), the brilliant Harvard student who conceived a Web site; Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), once Zuckerberg\'s close friend, who provided the seed money for the fledgling company; Napster founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), who brought Facebook to Silicon Valley\'s venture capitalists; and the Winklevoss twins (Armie Hammer and Josh Pence), the Harvard classmates who asserted that Zuckerberg stole their idea and then sued him for ownership of it. Each has his own narrative, his own version of the Facebook story in this multi-level portrait of 21st Century success--both the youthful fantasy of it and its finite realities as well.\r\n-\r\nColumbia Pictures\r\n\r\nAs told through flashbacks via deposition hearings for two concurrent lawsuits, the development and early days of the social networking website Facebook is presented. Harvard students Mark Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin - officially listed as the co-founders of the website - were once best friends. Based on an on-line blog about his ex-girlfriend and a site he developed allowing its users to rate the hotness factor of girls on campus, Zuckerberg, who exhibited a streak of arrogance, was asked by fellow Harvardites, wealthy twins Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss, and their friend Divya Narendra, to enter into an agreement to develop a social networking website specifically for Harvard students, the attraction for people to visit it being its exclusivity solely to Harvard students. Zuckerberg agreed. Zuckerberg, with financing from his friend Saverin, decided instead to develop his own website without telling the \"Winklevi\" (as he calls the twins) and Narenda. Zuckerberg\'s assertion was that he never used a line of code provided by the three in his work. As \"thefacebook\" as it was then called began to blossom, the twins and Narenda had to figure out what to do to regain what they believed their intellectual property without having to sue, since that\'s not what gentlemanly Harvardites do. As the site was brought to more and more university campuses, Zuckerberg and Saverin began to have a difference of opinion: Saverin wanted to sell ad space to generate revenue (as he had been the website\'s sole financier and he had profit mentality based on being an economics major), while Zuckerberg, never one interested in money, didn\'t want to go that route as the ads would make the site lose its \"cool\" factor, which made it popular. The site attracted the attention of the founder of Napster, Sean Parker, whose own dot com life had its spectacular ups and spectacular downs. As Parker ingratiated himself into Facebook\'s life (much to Saverin\'s chagrin) and as Zuckerberg began increasingly to side with Parker, Saverin slowly began to be phased out of both Zuckerberg\'s personal and professional life.\r\n-\r\nMark Zuckerberg\r\n\r\nNot very good at expressing himself in person, Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) first alienates himself from his girlfriend, who feels conversing with him is like working the \'stairmaster\', while taking strong exception to his condescending remarks towards her. He and his buddy, Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), plagiarize a proposed networking website from Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra, made exclusively for Harvadites - re-naming it \'The Facebook\'. This site connects students, describes what drives life in college, who\'s single, and how to hook-up with girls. Both then are approached by Napster-fame Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), and upon his advise, \'The\' is removed - giving birth to the now-revolutionary \'Facebook\' - that can be accessed by anyone worldwide - not just a few exclusive campuses. But his competitiveness, inability to communicate, and the urge to be number one, will alienate him, and result in two lawsuits - one from the Winklevoss twins - and the second from none other than Eduardo himself.\r\n-\r\nrAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)\r\n\r\nThe story of the creators of Facebook and the subsequent legal battles that stretched out over several years. Told mostly in flashbacks while Mark Zuckerman gives depositions in two lawsuits, the idea of a shareable social information site came to him one night after he hacked into his school\'s database and published the photos of all the women at the school. One of his roommates, Eduardo Saverin, provides the upfront financing and Zuckerman deftly outmaneuvers two other students who had a similar idea. The relationship with Saverin deteriorates and he soon finding himself on the outside looking in. All in all, an unflattering picture of all those involved.\r\n-\r\ngarykmcd\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Harvard undergrad and computer genius Mark Zuckerberg begins work on a new concept that eventually turns into the global social network known as Facebook. Six years later, he is one of the youngest billionaires ever, but Zuckerberg finds that his unprecedented success leads to both personal and legal complications when he ends up on the receiving end of two lawsuits, one involving his former friend (Andrew Garfield).

Meanwhile, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson and his best friend Fabrizio De Rossi win third-class tickets to the ship in a game. And she explains the whole story from departure until the death of Titanic on its first and last voyage April 15th, 1912 at 2:20 in the morning.\r\n-\r\nAnthony Pereyra\r\n\r\nAfter winning a trip on the RMS Titanic during a dockside card game, American Jack Dawson spots the society girl Rose DeWitt Bukater who is on her way to Philadelphia to marry her rich snob fiancÃ© Caledon Hockley. Rose feels helplessly trapped by her situation and makes her way to the aft deck and thinks of suicide until she is rescued by Jack. Cal is therefore obliged to invite Jack to dine at their first-class table where he suffers through the slights of his snobbish hosts. In return, he spirits Rose off to third-class for an evening of dancing, giving her the time of her life. Deciding to forsake her intended future all together, Rose asks Jack, who has made his living making sketches on the streets of Paris, to draw her in the nude wearing the invaluable blue diamond Cal has given her. Cal finds out and has Jack locked away. Soon afterwards, the ship hits an iceberg and Rose must find Jack while both must run from Cal even as the ship sinks deeper into the freezing water.\r\n-\r\nhEmRaJ (gavin_coolhgr@hotmail.com)\r\n\r\nA love story doomed by the depths of the Atlantic Ocean. Rose Calvert, now 101 reminiscences her experience of the Titanic, to American oceanic explorers, and her emotional connection with another passenger, Jack. Jack was an American starving artist who won a trip home on the Ship of Dreams to a lucky hand in poker. His luck unfortunately ran out on April 15, 1912 after colliding with an iceberg in the northern Mid-Atlantic. Four days before the unsinkable ship began to fill with ice cold sea water, Rose and Jack\'s love story began. Rose was suppose to marry her mother\'s pick of a fine gentlemen Cal Hockley, who was only attracted to Rose by her beauty and family fortune. Rose however felt she was in a crowded room screaming for help with no one to hear. Jack did hear her, with someone to finally listen, Rose couldn\'t deny her feelings for Jack anymore. Their love came to a new level, when Rose asked Jack to draw her like one of his \"french girls\" wearing only the rarest diamond, the Heart of the Ocean. A fun filled, romantic love affair between Jack and Rose couldn\'t be denied and Cal\'s pockets began to feel empty and he became jealous of Jack searching for a way to compromise Rose\'s love for Jack. The Titanic then collides with a large iceberg and begins to sink. As the ship lowers itself into the depths of the ocean, Jack and Rose must fight death of the freezing water and await a rescue ship. 84 years later Rose hears of the Titanic and the discovery of her drawing and meets with the explorers, her memories are where our story begins. The Titanic is a powerful story of survival, love and heroism. A love story that will never let go of the hearts of the people around the world.\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan\r\n\r\nDeep on the bottom of the sea, some 3800 meters below the surface of the freezing Atlantic Ocean, lies the wreckage of a ship. It is the unmistakable figure of the Titanic, once man\'s greatest mechanical achievement, now stripped of its former glory. Almost a century later, Brock Lovett, a modern treasure hunter intrigued by Titanic\'s hidden riches, and his well-equipped technical crew are digging for answers for the past three years; nevertheless, without any success. But, when Rose Calvert, one of Titanic\'s few survivors, learns about Lovett\'s crusade, she will begin to unfold her incredible, heartfelt and utterly tragic story that intertwines King Louis XVI\'s deep-blue \"Heart of the Ocean\" diamond, with her unlikely romance with the young bohemian vagabond, Jack Dawson. Can the past\'s mistakes teach a lesson in humility to both paupers and royalty?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nDeep-sea explorer Brock Lovett has reached the most famous shipwreck of all - the Titanic. Emerging with a safe believed to contain a diamond called \'The Heart of the Ocean\', he discovers the safe does not hold the diamond but a drawing of a beautiful woman wearing it. When Brock is later interviewed on TV, he shows the drawing to the cameras, and a 100-year-old woman named Rose Calvert living in Michigan recognizes the woman in the drawing - herself! On a visit to Brock\'s explorer ship over the wreck, Rose tells her story of the Titanic and its ill-fated voyage. Engaged to a would-be steel magnate, Caledon Hockley, she boards the Titanic\'s first-class suites with him and her mother in Southampton. Also boarding are Jack Dawson and his best friend Fabrizio De Rossi, after a lucky poker game wins them tickets in steerage. When Rose attempts suicide by jumping off the stern in third-class, Jack pulls her back onto the ship... and a bond is forged between them as Jack is invited by her into first-class the following day. Rose\'s mother and Caledon Hockley try desperate measures to keep them apart. But that strategy goes out the window when the Titanic collides with an iceberg, and due to a design flaw begins to sink - despite being proclaimed \'unsinkable\'. Now Rose and Jack must fight to stay alive, but is young Jack already doomed because of his lower status as a steerage passenger?\r\n-\r\nDerek O\'Cain', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-04-30', '', '2020-04-09 04:34:16', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBelgium::KT/EA\r\nBrazil::Livre\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE\r\nFinland::K-12/9\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-13\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::10\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::12\r\nIsrael::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::A\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::TV-PG', 12),

Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) has abandoned his life as a CIA assassin and has been traveling beneath the agency\'s radar, eventually reconnecting with Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente), the woman he loves. But Bourne is haunted by vivid dreams and troubling memories of his days as a killer, and he\'s not certain how much really happened and how much is a product of his imagination. When Bourne is led out of hiding by circumstances beyond his control, he must reconcile his past and present as he struggles to keep Marie out of harm\'s way and foil an international incident with dangerous consequences.\r\n\r\nWhen a CIA operation to purchase classified Russian documents is blown by a rival agent--who then shows up in the sleepy seaside village where Bourne and Marie have been living under assumed names--the pair collapse their lives and head out.

Without even knowing it, they, especially Mr. and Mrs. Kim, literally smell of poverty. Often as a collective, they perpetrate minor scams to get by, and even when they have jobs, they do the minimum work required. Ki-woo is the one who has dreams of getting out of poverty by one day going to university. Despite not having that university education, Ki-woo is chosen by his university student friend Min, who is leaving to go to school, to take over his tutoring job to Park Da-hye, who Min plans to date once he returns to Seoul and she herself is in university. The Parks are a wealthy family who for four years have lived in their modernistic house designed by and the former residence of famed architect Namgoong. While Mr. and Mrs. Park are all about status, Mrs. Park has a flighty, simpleminded mentality and temperament, which Min tells Ki-woo to feel comfortable in lying to her about his education to get the job. In getting the job, Ki-woo further learns that Mrs. Park is looking for an art therapist for the Parks\' adolescent son, Da-song, Ki-woo quickly recommending his professional art therapist friend \"Jessica\", really Ki-jung who he knows can pull off the scam in being the easiest liar of the four Kims. In Ki-woo also falling for Da-hye, he begins to envision himself in that house, and thus the Kims as a collective start a plan for all the Kims, like Ki-jung using assumed names, to replace existing servants in the Parks\' employ in orchestrating reasons for them to be fired. The most difficult to get rid of may be Moon-gwang, the Parks\' housekeeper who literally came with the house - she Namgoong\'s housekeeper when he lived there - and thus knows all the little nooks and crannies of it better than the Parks themselves. The question then becomes how far the Kims can take this scam in their quest to become their version of the Parks.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nJobless, penniless, and, above all, hopeless, the unmotivated patriarch, Ki-taek, and his equally unambitious family--his supportive wife, Chung-sook; his cynical twentysomething daughter, Ki-jung, and his college-age son, Ki-woo--occupy themselves by working for peanuts in their squalid basement-level apartment. Then, by sheer luck, a lucrative business proposition will pave the way for an ingeniously insidious scheme, as Ki-woo summons up the courage to pose as an English tutor for the teenage daughter of the affluent Park family. Now, the stage seems set for an unceasing winner-take-all class war. How does one get rid of a parasite?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nThrough an elaborate and ingenious scheme, the poor Kim family manage to trick the affluent and naive Park family into making them their servants. But unbeknownst to the Kims, the Park house harbors a dark secret which could cause the collapse of the newly formed symbiosis.\r\n-\r\ngoddangwatir', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-04-30', '', '2020-04-09 16:34:35', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 1, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nBelgium::KT/EA\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::14\r\nColombia::15\r\nEcuador::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::Tous publics avec avertissement\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-15\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::17+\r\nIreland::16\r\nIsrael::16\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nLuxembourg::12\r\nMalaysia::18\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R13\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPortugal::M/14\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nThailand::15\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUkraine::16\r\nVietnam::C18', 18),

John should have already been executed, except the Continental\'s manager, Winston, has given him a one-hour grace period before he\'s \'Excommunicado\' - membership revoked, banned from all services and cut off from other members.

With every ambitious nobody in the business itching to terminate the excommunicated cardinal of destruction, John has to do battle with pitilessly endless waves of the High Table\'s murderous cut-throats, against the backdrop of a fatal mistake at the neutral Continental Hotel, and a long-standing feud over an innocent puppy. Indeed, many have tried to claim John\'s head; however, dead men can\'t spend money. Now, the artist of suffering prepares for war.

Bond-seller Nick Carraway, in a sanitarium for depression and alcoholism, is persuaded by his doctor to write a therapeutic account of what put him there. Nick\'s journal describes how, seven years earlier, he had moved to a tiny house on Long Island adjoining the sumptuous mansion owned by enigmatic neighbour, the fabulously wealthy Jay Gatsby. After attending one of Gatsby\'s legendary parties Nick is asked by Gatsby to arrange a meeting with his cousin, Daisy, now married to the brutish and philandering Tom Buchanan, who was Gatsby\'s true love, prior to war service. As Nick complies he comes to see that Gatsby, once a poor boy, has recreated himself as a fascinating millionaire purely to win Daisy back but the events of a drunken afternoon conspire to bring about an ending which is anything but happy.\r\n-\r\ndon @ minifie-1\r\n\r\nMidwest native Nick Carraway arrives in 1922 New York in search of the American dream. Nick, a would-be writer, moves in next-door to millionaire Jay Gatsby and across the bay from his cousin Daisy and her philandering husband, Tom (Joel Edgerton).

Settling into a home next door to wealthy Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio), Carraway grows increasingly fascinated by the elaborate parties held at his new neighbor\'s estate. Meanwhile, across the bay, Carraway\'s cousin Daisy (Carey Mulligan) flounders in her marriage to philandering aristocrat Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton). Inspired by the debauchery on display at Gatsby\'s wild parties and the lives of the wealthy elite, Carraway begins putting pen to paper as it gradually becomes clear that his cousin and the millionaire share a complicated romantic past that remains unresolved..\r\n\r\nA lavish world of decadence and ebullience awaits the innocent Midwesterner and aspiring writer, Nick Carraway, in F. Scott Fitzgerald\'s cinematic adaptation of The Great Gatsby, as he moves into a little cottage in Long Island during the Roaring Twenties. In pursuit of the elusive American Dream, instead, the humble bond-seller strikes an acquaintance with his mysterious, self-made millionaire neighbour, Jay Gatsby, whose extravagant bacchanalian gatherings are the talk of West Egg.

Years later, shortly after being rescued from the Maze, Thomas and the remaining Gladers - Teresa Agnes, Newt, Minho, Frypan, and Winston - are taken to a facility run by Mr. Janson. He explains that the facility is a safe haven, protecting them from WCKD, the Flare virus and the \"Cranks\", and provides them clothes, food, and sanitation, where other survivors of multiple mazes are also present. Thomas becomes curious about their activities and manages to find out what is really happening behind the closed doors. With help from Aris, the first maze survivor to end up in the facility, Thomas discovers that WCKD\'s leader, Ava, is still alive and that Mr. Janson is really working for WCKD, when they discuss experiments on the Immunes and that Janson has yet to find the Right Arm, a resistance group located in the mountains.

Coming out of tiny Macedonia (today part of Greece), Alexander led his armies against the mighty Persian Empire, drove west to Egypt, and finally made his way east to India. This movie concentrated on those eight years of battles, as well as his relationship with his boyhood friend and battle mate, Hephaistion (Jared Leto). Alexander died young, of illness, at the age of thirty-two. Alexander\'s conquests paved the way for the spread of Greek culture (facilitating the spread of Christianity centuries later), and removed many of the obstacles that might have prevented the expansion of the Roman Empire. In other words, the world we know today might never have been if not for Alexander\'s bloody, yet unifying, conquest.\r\n-\r\naustin4577@aol.com\r\n\r\nThis movie traces the short, but adventurous life of the Macedonian conqueror, Alexander the Great (356-323 B.C.) (Colin Farrell), who conquered almost the entire known world of his era. From his childhood as the son of King Philip II (Val Kilmer), to ascending the throne at age twenty in 336 B.C. upon his father\'s murder, and starting in 334 B.C., Alexander crossed into Asia on his eleven-year conquest of the known world. From his conquests of Egypt, to battles with the Persians and the capture of Babylon, operations near Maracanda and in Afghanistan, and pushing all the way to India where he reigned unchallenged before his sudden death at the age of thirty-two. Though Alexander made use of the well-oiled army created by his father, he pushed the limits of Macedonian and Greek power to levels of which King Philip II (Val Kilmer) could not have dreamed.\r\n\r\nHistorical, glamorous biopic (with mystical and religious elements) about the life of famous Macedonian ruler and conqueror Alexander the Great (356-323 B.C.) (Colin Farrell), mainly concentrating on his youth and his conquering of Persia and India. The son of Macedonian King Phillip II (Val Kilmer) and his wife Olympias (Angelina Jolie) became King when he was twenty-years-old and died at the age of thirty-two, by this time having conquered ninety percent of the world as it was explored by the time he lived, ruling over parts of three continents and several countries.\r\n-\r\nsmoothhoney1265', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-13 11:38:47', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::MA\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::TE\r\nCzech Republic::12\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-15\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::15\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG-12\r\nMalaysia::18PL\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R13\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R', 12),

Starring Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette as Mason\'s parents and newcomer Lorelei Linklater as his sister Samantha, BOYHOOD charts the rocky terrain of childhood like no other film has before. Snapshots of adolescence from road trips and family dinners to birthdays and graduations and all the moments in between become transcendent, set to a soundtrack spanning the years from Coldplay\'s Yellow to Arcade Fire\'s Deep Blue. BOYHOOD is both a nostalgic time capsule of the recent past and an ode to growing up and parenting.\r\n-\r\nRichard Linklater\r\n\r\nTwelve years in the less than nuclear life of a nuclear Texas family - father Mason, mother Olivia, oldest offspring Samantha, and youngest offspring Mason Jr. - is presented, focusing on the younger Mason\'s entire public school years, he sometimes referred to as MJ when in the presence of his father. This phase of their story begins in 2002 when Olivia and Mason, who originally married because she was pregnant, are now divorced, the marriage which was destined to dissolve due to these circumstances. Olivia has custody of the two children, and when he is around, Mason has weekend visitation rights, which has not happened in the last year or so as he stated he, an aspiring musician and somewhat irresponsible young adult, was \"away somewhere in Alaska\" trying to find himself. Olivia wants to eke out a better life for herself and the kids in a way that will also satisfy her own emotional needs. The two parents also try to move on with their sexual and relationship lives in the high probability that they will never reconcile, much against their children\'s own wants. MJ\'s growing up is affected by these circumstances and whatever the situation at the time outwardly orchestrated by Olivia (but often manipulated by others), and by his relationship with his family members - who evolve as they each grow up chronologically and emotionally - and others in his ever changing life.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nA 12 year story of Mason the Younger, and his sister, Samantha lived a rough life with their mother, Olivia, divorced with their father, Mason. Mason is always giving them advices about living a simple life, when they were hanging out on the weekends. In their American-life journey, Mason Jr. must face the reality that his parents will never be together, started when his parents chose to marry again with other persons, and he must try to focus chasing his own career and achieving his dreams, step-by-step, even when the conditions are awful and full of ugly truths.\r\n-\r\nGusde\r\n\r\nRichard Linklater\'s Boyhood is a coming-of-age drama that the director spent twelve years making. He cast a young boy, Ellar Coltrane, and shot the film a few days at a time for over a decade so that he could capture how his leading actor, and the rest of his cast, aged. The film\'s story simply follows a boy named Mason (Coltrane) as he progresses from age 6 to 18 and deals with the typical travails of childhood like his parents\' divorce, bad stepparents, falling in love, finding his artistic voice, and fighting with his bratty older sister..', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-13 11:47:52', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::14\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::6\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::7\r\nIndia::A\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMaldives::18+\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::6\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::7\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::NC16\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::7\r\nSwitzerland::10\r\nThailand::13\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R', 18),

In this dystopian world, humans have been incapable of reproducing for eighteen years for an unknown reason, meaning the imminent extinction of the species. Britain is the one remaining civilized society on the planet, which has resulted in people wanting to immigrate there. As such, it has become a police state in order to handle the immigrants, who are placed into refugee camps. Lowly government bureaucrat Theo Faron, once an activist, is approached by the Fishes, deemed a terrorist group, led by his ex-wife Julian Taylor, who he has not seen in close to twenty years, their marriage which disintegrated following the death of their infant son Dylan during the 2008 flu pandemic. Although the Fishes did use terrorist means in their on-going revolution against the state in the fight for immigrant rights, Julian vows that they now garner support solely by speaking to the people. What she wants is for Theo to use his connections to get transit papers for a young immigrant woman named Kee who needs to get to the coast. Although initially reluctant to do it because of the difficulty, Theo is able to grant Julian this favor, however with the change that he now needs to accompany Kee on her journey. As Theo and Kee progress on that journey, Theo learns more and more about what\'s going on, including the reason that Kee needs to get to the coast, the fact that no one in the group knows if their end destination even exists, and that his and Kee\'s lives are in greater danger than he believed when they started the journey. But Theo\'s sole mission becomes to help Kee at any cost for the survival of the species.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nThe world\'s youngest citizen has just died at the age of eighteen, and humankind is facing the likelihood of its own extinction.

The world\'s youngest citizen has just died at the age of eighteen, and humankind is facing the likelihood of its own extinction. Set against a backdrop of London torn apart by violence and warring nationalistic sects, this movie follows an unlikely champion of Earth\'s survival: Theo, a disillusioned ex-activist turned bureaucrat, who is forced to face his own demons and protect the planet\'s last remaining hope.\r\n\r\nWorld divisions, chaos and anarchy, these are the ways the world and the last remaining inhabitants are checking out.

Unwittingly drawn into their plight, learning who can be trusted, who can be dependable, and how he must hold the most precious secret the Human race has been so longing to hear, the miracle that can change the course of Humanity; the first pregnant woman in eighteen years. On the run, he, Kee and Miriam must travel cross-country, on the run, terrified and helpless to the safe haven of the Human Project.

With female fertility becoming obsolete, Man cannot reproduce, and no child has been born on the face of the Earth for eighteen years. Man, and his future, is dying. Soon he shall be extinct. Theo, the beaten, downtrodden and middle-aged ex-political activist will, unwittingly, become involved in a war of an underground revolt. Here, he is active once more, in the perilous journey across England\'s home counties, with a young girl, Kee, who, to Theo\'s bewilderment is pregnant.

Her young son dies later the same day. Her husband Mitch however seems immune. Thus begins the spread of a deadly infection. For doctors and administrators at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, several days pass before anyone realizes the extent or gravity of this new infection. They must first identify the type of virus in question and then find a means of combating it, a process that will likely take several months. As the contagion spreads to millions of people worldwide, societal order begins to break down as people panic.\r\n-\r\ngarykmcd\r\n\r\nBeth Emhoff (Gwenyth Paltrow) returns from a business trip to Hong Kong with a stop over at the Chicago airport, where she has sex with her former lover. Beth feels ill, but thinks the problem is jet leg. She travels back home to Minneapolis and spreads the virus to her son Clark and her husband, Mitch. When Beth and Clark die, Mitch goes in quarantine where the doctors realise he is immune to the mysterious virus. Meanwhile in Hong Kong, London and in a small province, cases of the mystery illness are cropping up, as the American CDC and the World Health Organization give their best effort researching the virus. A race against the clock begins, as the virus is spreading in a geometric progression, and if no solution is found - very fast - humanity will cease to be.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nUnable to comprehend the sudden and untimely demise of his fit-as-a-fiddle wife, Beth, and his equally healthy son, Clark, suddenly, the grieving father, Mitch Emhoff, finds himself quarantined and in shock. In the meantime, as a virulent pathogen is infecting thousands around the globe, the Center for Disease Control and the World Health Organisation struggle to figure out the origin and the rapid progress of the virus; but, in vain. Now, against the backdrop of an unprecedented situation and the hunt for Patient Zero, nothing makes sense, and what\'s even more dangerous, self-appointed prophets manipulate the masses, as riots erupt, economies collapse, and people perish by the thousands. But, the invisible adversary is everywhere, there\'s still no cure for the lethal disease, and more or less, the average person touches his face nearly 3,000 times a day.

Watching him get his degree are his wealthy parents, Walt McCandless and Billie McCandless, and his teenaged sister, Carine McCandless. Before his parents and sister head home to Virginia following the convocation, Chris, refusing his parents\' gift of a new car to replace his old Datsun which he states works perfectly fine, tells them that he has thoughts of going into Harvard Law, he having received excellent grades in what were largely classes focusing on global social consciousness. Walt, Billie and Carine will learn by the end of the summer that Chris had no intention of going to Harvard as he has since moved from his apartment in Atlanta without a word to them, he arranging with the post office to hold his mail for a couple of months before being \"returned to sender\" to give him a head start in his escape from his family. Chris\' Datsun is eventually discovered abandoned in the Arizona desert, the authorities believing it being done on purpose as opposed to Chris being abducted. Walt and Billie intend to continue to search for Chris until they know conclusively what has happened to him. Carine, having had much the same upbringing as Chris, believes she understands what he is doing in making this escape. What he has done is either donated most of his money to Oxfam or burned it, and has destroyed all of his ID in an effort to start life anew as a child of the Earth, he rechristening himself Alexander Supertramp. This move is in rebellion to much of western society, and most specifically against the type of life his parents epitomize, they who he believes should never have gotten married and are hypocrites in portraying what they believe society expects of them, being generally unhappy with each other and life in the process. He ultimately wants to live off the land, carrying with him only what material possessions he will need, but wants to experience freedom by traveling the country by thumbing rides or riding the rails, working the odd job until he earns enough to purchase what he needs at any give time, and obtaining some skills he knows he will need to survive in the destination he has in mind when he is ready: the wilds of Alaska. Despite stating that he does not want or need attachments, he does make some human connections along the way, and not necessarily to/with like-minded people.\r\n-\r\nChristopher McCandless', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-13 11:53:21', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 1, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::10\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::G\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-11\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::7\r\nIndia::16\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNorway::11\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::7\r\nSweden::7\r\nSwitzerland::10\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R', 13);

He has mental health issues, part of which involves uncontrollable laughter. Times are tough and, due to his issues and occupation, Arthur has an even worse time than most. Over time these issues bear down on him, shaping his actions, making him ultimately take on the persona he is more known as...Joker.\r\n-\r\ngrantss\r\n\r\nArthur Fleck is a wannabe stand-up comic who suffers from many mental illnesses, including one which causes him to laugh uncontrollably when he is nervous, and often gets him into bad situations. Arthur\'s mental health causes almost all people in society to reject and look down upon him, even though all he wants is to be accepted by others. After being brutally beaten, having his medication cut off, Arthur\'s life begins to spiral downward out-of-control into delusions, violence, and anarchy until he eventually transforms into Gotham\'s infamous Clown-Prince of Crime.\r\n-\r\ngeometrydashbroham\r\n\r\nA socially inept clown for hire - Arthur Fleck aspires to be a stand up comedian among his small job working dressed as a clown holding a sign for advertising.

Dealing with all the negativity and bullying from society he heads downwards on a spiral, in turn showing how his alter ego \"Joker\", came to be.\r\n-\r\ncrisspaggos\r\n\r\nStruggling to make people laugh in grim early-1980s Gotham City, the mentally ill street clown and failed stand-up comedian, Arthur Fleck, wears his smudgy makeup every day to eke out an existence. Mocked, bullied, and above all, marginalised, Fleck\'s slippery grip on reality will pave the way for a gradual descent into a dark world of unrestrained violence, as a loaded revolver enters the picture offering the long-awaited liberation. Then, the medications stopped working, and troubled Arthur\'s fierce hatred seems to be the only way out. Is the world prepared for the gloriously malevolent advent of the grinned super-villain, Joker?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nForever alone in a crowd, failed comedian Arthur Fleck seeks connection as he walks the streets of Gotham City. Arthur wears two masks -- the one he paints for his day job as a clown, and the guise he projects in a futile attempt to feel like he\'s part of the world around him. Isolated, bullied and disregarded by society, Fleck begins a slow descent into madness as he transforms into the criminal mastermind known as the Joker.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-13 11:54:16', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nAustria::16\r\nBelgium::KNT/ENA\r\nBrazil::16\r\nBulgaria::D\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::14\r\nColombia::15\r\nCzech Republic::15\r\nDenmark::15\r\nEcuador::18\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::12 avec avertissement\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::A-18\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::17+\r\nIreland::18\r\nIsrael::16\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nJapan::R15+\r\nLithuania::N-16\r\nLuxembourg::16\r\nMalaysia::18\r\nMaldives::18+\r\nMalta::15\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNigeria::18\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::R-16\r\nPoland::15\r\nPortugal::M/14\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::NC16\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::18\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nTaiwan::R-15\r\nThailand::18\r\nTurkey::18+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUkraine::16\r\nVietnam::C18', 18),

The most promising offer turns out to be the driver for the African-American classical pianist Don Shirley for a concert tour into the Deep South states. Although hardly enthused at working for a black man, Tony accepts the job and they begin their trek armed with The Negro Motorist Green Book, a travel guide for safe travel through America\'s racial segregation. Together, the snobbishly erudite pianist and the crudely practical bouncer can barely get along with their clashing attitudes to life and ideals. However, as the disparate pair witness and endure America\'s appalling injustices on the road, they find a newfound respect for each other\'s talents and start to face them together. In doing so, they would nurture a friendship and understanding that would change both their lives.\r\n-\r\nKenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com)\r\n\r\nNew York City bouncer Frank \"Tony Lip\" Vallelonga is searching for new employment after his nightclub is closed for renovations, eventually landing an interview as a driver for \"Doc\" Don Shirley, a famed pianist. Their first encounter does not go well, as Tony\'s flippant, uncultured behavior clashes with Don\'s sophisticated, reserved demeanor. However, Don eventually hires Tony on the strength of others\' word, as he needs someone who can help him stay out of trouble during an eight-week concert tour through the Deep South. They embark with plans to return home on Christmas Eve. Tony is given a copy of the Green Book by Don\'s record studio: a guide for black travelers to find safe havens throughout the segregated South. They begin the tour in the Midwest before eventually heading further south. Tony and Don clash over their differences, as Tony feels uncomfortable being asked to act properly, while Don is disgusted by Tony\'s habits. Regardless, Tony finds himself impressed with Don\'s talent on the piano, and increasingly disgusted by the discriminatory treatment the latter receives by the hosts when he is not on stage. After a bar incident leads to a group of white men threatening Don\'s life, Tony rescues him by threatening to pull a gun on them. He instructs Don not to go out without him for the rest of the tour.\r\n\r\nDr Don Shirley is a world-class African-American pianist, who is about to embark on a concert tour in the Deep South in 1962. In need of a driver and protection, Shirley recruits Tony Lip, a tough-talking bouncer from an Italian-American neighbourhood in the Bronx. Despite their differences, the two men soon develop an unexpected bond while confronting racism and danger in an era of segregation.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nIn early-1960s openly and legally segregated America, two polar opposites--the distinguished and refined African-American classical pianist, Don Shirley, and the uncultivated Italian-American nightclub bouncer, Tony Vallelonga--are about to form an unlikely friendship. With New York\'s Copacabana Club being renovated, Don and his new problem-solver chauffeur embark on a lengthy two-month concert tour through the hostile Deep South, equipped only with a subtly tremendous talent, a serenely resilient dignity, and a little vert guide book for visitors--The Negro Motorist Green-Book. Before endless kilometres of unfriendly territory, a single man chooses the hard way for the sake of progress; however, can one person make a difference?\r\n-\r\nDon Shirley\r\n\r\nOctober, 1962. Italian-American Bronx native Tony Vallelonga - long called Tony Lip by those that know him for being able to BS his way out of anything - largely uses that ability to BS, his street smarts and his fists to do his job in \"customer relations\" (i.e. a glorified bouncer) at the Copa, where he has to deal with well dressed toughs and thugs, albeit with a smile and often without they knowing that he is screwing them. Like most of his Italian-American friends and family, he is a working class bigot, as demonstrated by his actions concerning some black laborers who did work in his and his wife Dolores\' apartment. With the Copa closed for renovations until the new year, Tony has to find another job in the interim, he, without telling Dolores, pawning some of his valuables in the meantime to put food on their and their two adolescent sons\' table. When he is given the inside scoop on a job working for Dr. Don Shirley, he only did not know before meeting Dr. Shirley that the Dr. refers to his multiple Ph.D.s, and that he is a classically trained pianist (the head of the popular music playing Don Shirley Trio) instead of a physician, but arguably most importantly that he is a well educated, wealthy and refined black man. The job is not only as chauffeur as Tony initially thought, but to be his all-expenses and well paid general foot soldier, especially in the area of security, for the eight week tour he has arranged for the trio with his record label, much of that tour in the Deep South (the last scheduled date being December 23rd in Birmingham, Alabama) hence the need for especially that security in he being black. Renegotiating the terms, learning that Dr. Shirley actually recruited him based on his reputation for being able to get the job done, and getting the okay from Dolores in the stipulation that he make it home for Christmas or else, Tony accepts the job. Beyond the obvious hazards of the race relations aspect of the job once they get to the Deep South, they will not only have to get over their own differences as humans in their moral and ethical values to survive with each other for eight weeks, but deal with the general role reversal of the uneducated white man being subservient to the well-educated black man.

As a boy, Arthur is left orphaned after his father, King Uther Pendragon, and mother are killed in a war waged against them by Vortigern, who then assumes the throne. Arthur flees and is raised in a brothel, knowing very little of his birthright. Vortigern wants Arthur dead, to ensure there is no claimant to the throne. The legends foretell that only the next king will be able to draw Excalibur, Uther\'s sword, from the rock where it is lodged. So, in an effort to identify Arthur, Vortigern forces all the young men of Arthur\'s age to attempt to draw out the sword. Now it is Arthur\'s turn.\r\n-\r\ngrantss\r\n\r\nMordred, an iron-fist-ed warlock, and his armies lay siege to Camelot, seeking to establish the dominance of magic-wielding mag-es over humankind. Uther Pendragon, king of the Britons, infiltrates Mordred\'s lair and beheads him, saving Camelot. Uther\'s treacherous younger brother Vortigern, who covets the throne, orchestrates a coup and sacrifices his wife Elsa to moat hags to become a demon knight, who kills Uther\'s wife Igraine and slays Uther in combat. The only survivor is Uther\'s son Arthur, who drifts away in a boat and ends up in Londinium..\r\n\r\nStruggling to eke out an existence in Londinium\'s squalid and perilous streets, the orphaned young fighter and Uther Pendragon\'s only son, Arthur, is utterly oblivious to the fact that he is England\'s rightful ruler. Nearly two decades after his traitorous uncle, Vortigern, usurped the throne, Arthur is now the only one who can pull out from the magical boulder the legendary and long-lost blade of Excalibur; however, Vortigern is hell-bent on identifying him, and then, stopping him.

A blacksmith named Balian has lost his family and nearly his faith. The religious wars raging in the far-off Holy Land seem remote to him, yet he is pulled into that immense drama. Amid the pageantry and intrigues of medieval Jerusalem he falls in love, grows into a leader, and ultimately uses all his courage and skill to defend the city against staggering odds. Destiny comes seeking Balian in the form of a great knight, Godfrey of Ibelin, a Crusader briefly home to France from fighting in the East. Revealing himself as Balian\'s father, Godfrey shows him the true meaning of knighthood and takes him on a journey across continents to the fabled Holy City. In Jerusalem at that moment--between the Second and Third Crusades--a fragile peace prevails, through the efforts of its enlightened Christian king, Baldwin IV, aided by his advisor Tiberias, and the military restraint of the legendary Muslim leader Saladin Ayubi . But Baldwin\'s days are numbered, and strains of fanaticism, greed, and jealousy among the Crusaders threaten to shatter the truce. King Baldwin\'s vision of peace--a kingdom of heaven--is shared by a handful of knights, including Godfrey of Ibelin, who swear to uphold it with their lives and honor. As Godfrey passes his sword to his son, he also passes on that sacred oath: to protect the helpless, safeguard the peace, and work toward harmony between religions and cultures, so that a kingdom of heaven can flourish on earth. Balian takes the sword and steps into history.\r\n-\r\nSujit R. Varma\r\n\r\nIn 1184, French village blacksmith Balian just lost his wife trough suicide grief-stricken by their child\'s death; the crusader lord Godfrey, baron of Ibelin, reveals himself as Balian\'s father and offers him a crusader life, which the youngster spontaneously rejects but after the local priest taunts him till his sword strikes fatally accepts, fleeing the French bishop\'s bloody justice and seeking divine forgiveness as promised to crusaders in Jerusalem. On the way, Balian is instructed the skills of war and chivalric honor code and dubbed a knight in Messina by his father, who was fatally wounded fighting off the bishop\'s men. After shipwreck on the Levantine coast, Balian soon proves himself a superior knight as fighter and noble idealist in the loyal service of leper king Baldwin, whose pragmatic right hand, the count of Tiberias, fails to convince Balian the ruthless knight Reynald de Chatillon and his traitorous master, candidate-heir to the throne Guy de Lusignan, must be stopped by all means before they plunge the crusader kingdom in a fatal war against the noble, militarily far superior Saracen king Saladin. When Tiberias is proven right, he leaves for Cyprus, brave Balian stays to defend besieged Jerusalem against impossible odds.\r\n-\r\nKGF Vissers', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-13 12:05:37', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 1, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::13+\r\nFinland::K-16/13\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndonesia::D\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nLithuania::N-7\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::NC-16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R', 13),

The ninth film from the writer-director features a large ensemble cast and multiple storylines in a tribute to the final moments of Hollywood\'s golden age.\r\n\r\n1969. Rick Dalton was once the star of a highly popular TV series but a few bad choices have set his career back, leaving him wondering if he should quit showbiz altogether. His best friend is Cliff Booth, an aging stuntman who was Dalton\'s stunt-double in movies and TV. His career is largely over. While Booth ekes out an existence, Dalton still lives a life of relative luxury in Hollywood, rubbing shoulders with the rich and famous. In fact, his neighbours are Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate.\r\n-\r\ngrantss\r\n\r\nSet in Los Angeles, 1969. Over the hill TV actor, Rick Dalton, and his best friend and stunt-double, Cliff Booth, strive to reignite their careers as their failure is juxtaposed with the success of Rick\'s new next door neighbours: Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski. Rick and Cliff become unwittingly entangled with the infamous Manson family in the process.\r\n-\r\njmcrighton-892-694446\r\n\r\nAfter a meteoric five-year rise to the top in the cut-throat world of dazzling Hollywood and a long decade of treading water, the once-young-and-popular action star, Rick Dalton, finds it difficult to swallow that the rapacious and always hungry for new blood film industry can do without him. Sensing that his career may be nearing its end, Rick along with his sympathetic confidant and former stunt double, Cliff Booth, face the grim possibility of a mundane new life in an ever-changing 1969 Los Angeles. Now, unlike his glamorous next-door neighbours--the young director fresh off the triumphant success of Rosemary\'s Baby (1968), Roman Polanski, and the rising star of The Wrecking Crew (1968), Sharon Tate--Rick has to make a difficult decision. Of course, none of them is aware that their fates, and their very lives, are on a collision course with a certain Charles Manson, and his army of ferociously zealous believers. Will Hollywood ever be the same after August 9, 1969?\r\n-\r\nRosemary\'s Baby (1968)\r\n\r\nActor Rick Dalton gained fame and fortune by starring in a 1950s television Western, but is now struggling to find meaningful work in a Hollywood that he doesn\'t recognize anymore. He spends most of his time drinking and palling around with Cliff Booth, his easygoing best friend and longtime stunt double. Rick also happens to live next door to Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate -- the filmmaker and budding actress whose futures will forever be altered by members of the Manson Family.\r\n-\r\nRoman Polanski', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-13 12:30:13', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nAustria::16\r\nBelgium::KT/EA\r\nBrazil::16\r\nBulgaria::D\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::14\r\nChina::(Banned)\r\nColombia::15\r\nCzech Republic::15\r\nDenmark::15\r\nEcuador::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::A-18\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::18\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::17+\r\nIreland::18\r\nIsrael::16\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nLithuania::N-16\r\nLuxembourg::16\r\nMalaysia::18\r\nMalta::18\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNigeria::18\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::R-16\r\nPoland::15\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Africa::18\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nThailand::18\r\nTurkey::18+\r\nUnited Kingdom::18\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUkraine::16\r\nVietnam::C18', 18),

Those in charge of the program explain to him that there is a bomb on the train, and that he must locate it. More importantly, he must identify the bomber as another bombing is expected later that day. He is also told however that he cannot change the past and can only gather information.

What\'s more, he is sitting across from a woman who knows him as teacher Sean Fentress. Looking in a mirror and checking his wallet for ID, he sees that he has indeed assumed Fentress\' body. Exactly eight minutes after he woke up and just as the train enters Chicago, a massive bomb explodes on the train killing everyone aboard. Next he knows, he is again Captain Colter Stevens, is strapped into a chair in a capsule, and is communicating via video link to Captain Goodwin, who reminds him that he is working on an experimental project, code named Beleaguered Castle. His current mission is to find the bomb aboard the train so that he can discover the identity of the bomber. He will be sent back to the time he awoke as Sean Fentress again and again only for those eight minutes, each time gathering more information until he discovers the bomber\'s identity. As he reluctantly works on this mission - reluctant in that he still believes he should be in Afghanistan - he tries to find out the underlying reason for the project, since he will learn that all aboard the train have died and will regardless, and why he was chosen for the project. As he finds out more and more, he has his own missions which may be contrary to what Goodwin and the project\'s architect, Rutledge, have in mind.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nJake Gyllenhaal headlines this Sci-Fi time-travel thriller directed by Moon\'s Duncan Jones from a script by Ben Ripley and Billy Ray. A bomb explodes on a Chicago train, derailing the locomotive and killing hundreds.

This realization unties new feelings, new thoughts and new hope for the put upon Gibert, something new is eating Gilbert Grape.\r\n-\r\nCinema_Fan\r\n\r\nThere isn\'t much for Gilbert to look forward to in the small, dying town of Endora. The only thing keeping him sane is his mentally-challenged brother, and his physically-challenged mother. Despite the challenges that are posed in this small town, Gilbert had forgotten that he has become challenged himself and, with the help of a marooned world traveler, begins to see the bigger picture.\r\n-\r\nMal Fee Zants\r\n\r\nSwedish director Lasse Hallstrom\'s follow-up to the underrated Once Around earned far more attention than its predecessor thanks to the judicious casting of perennial thinking woman\'s heartthrob Johnny Depp and a certain up-and-coming thespian by the name of Leonardo DiCaprio. A prisoner of his dysfunctional family\'s broken dreams in tiny Endora, IA, Gilbert (Depp) serves as breadwinner and caretaker for his mother and siblings following his father\'s suicide and his older brother\'s defection. Momma (Darlene Cates) is a morbidly obese shut-in who hasn\'t left the house in seven years; her children include Arnie (DiCaprio), who\'s about to turn 18 despite a host of negative medical forecasts, and terminally embarrassed Ellen (Mary Kate Schellhardt), who\'s emerging from an awkward adolescence. When he\'s not taking care of the difficult but tender Arnie, Gilbert spends his time fixing up the family\'s tattered farmhouse, working at a failing mom-and-pop grocery store and hanging with local misfits Bobby (Crispin Glover), an overly ambitious junior undertaker, and Tucker (John C. Reilly), a handyman who hankers after a job at the new burger franchise. Into this complicated but essentially unchanging social universe steps Becky (Juliette Lewis), a thoughtful young woman who\'s been escorting her nomadic grandmother from state to state in a mobile-home caravan. As Becky teaches Gilbert to finally consider his own happiness for a change, she disrupts both his family obligations and his long-running affair with a lonely housewife (Mary Steenburgen).\r\n\r\nThis film tells a story about Gilbert Grape. He is a grocery store worker who is burdened by his family\'s needs. He cares and provides for a intellectually disabled young adult brother and a morbidly obese mother. The Grape household has deteriorated since the suicide of their father and Gilbert bares the weight (no pun intended) of a struggling poor American family. In this tale, Gilbert has a string of risky affairs which complicates matters. This movie tells a more realistic version of the trails and tribulations of barely functioning family in the mid-west of America.\r\n\r\nGilbert Grape lives in Endora, a place where nothing much happens. The only times the police get something to do is when Gilbert\'s autistic brother Arnie tries to climb up on the watertower nearby. Taking care of Arnie is mostly Gilbert\'s task which can be pretty demanding, at least while you are working at the local grocery store. Then one day Becky and her grandmother pass through Endora getting trouble with the car. Gilbert falls in love with Becky, but gets problems when he tries to find time for his own private life.\r\n-\r\nLars J.

These robbers never leave their Charlestown life on their own volition, the neighborhood where there is an unwritten code to protect that lifestyle. Such robbers include friends Doug MacRay, James Coughlin, Albert \'Gloansy\' Magloan and Desmond Elden. Doug and James in particular treat each other like family, as the Coughlins have realistically been as such to Doug since Doug\'s mother ran off and Doug\'s father, Stephen MacRay, was sent to prison. James\' single mother sister, the drugged out Krista Coughlin, and Doug have a casual sexual relationship. The foursome carry out a mostly successful bank robbery, but due to circumstances take the bank manager, Claire Keesey, hostage for a short period before releasing her physically unharmed. They find out that Claire lives in Charlestown, so they want to ensure that she did not see anything that could incriminate them if they were to ever run into her. As such, Doug begins a personal relationship with her to find out what she knows and what she\'s told the police and the FBI, who have taken charge of the investigation. He learns that she has kept some information from the authorities for her own protection but information that could identify James in particular. But Doug slowly falls for her, as she does for him. Ultimately, Doug dreams about leaving his Charlestown life to be with Claire anywhere but there. But Doug has to try and keep his true identity from her, and keep the fact that he is seeing her from his colleagues. But leaving is not as easy as he would like as he and the gang are tasked with a big job by a local gangster named Fergie whether Doug likes it or not. And Adam Frawley, the FBI\'s lead investigator, comes into evidence that links the foursome to the bank robbery and a subsequent armored car heist, so is on their tail for evidence that will send them away dead or alive.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nIn Boston\'s bleak Charlestown, criminals depend on a code of silence; those caught serve their time. Doug MacRay masterminds bank robberies with three friends: the hotheaded Jem, Des, an electrician, and Al, their driver. After a dicey bank job, Doug must make sure the female bank manager, Claire, who lives in Charlestown, doesn\'t know who they are. He contrives to meet her and then finds her appealing. As the FBI zeroes in on the gang, Doug wants out, Claire doesn\'t know who he really is, and Jem and their money launderer, an aging florist, insist that Doug do one more job. Are prison and death the only ways out of Charlestown?\r\n-\r\n\r\nAfter the heist of the Cambridge Merchants Bank, the four thieves blindfold and kidnap the manager Claire Keesey. They take her driver license; release her at an empty beach; and head to Charlestown, Boston. Later, the friends Doug MacRay, James Coughlin, Albert \'Gloansy\' Magloan and Desmond Elden find that Claire also lives in Charlestown and they decide to monitor her steps. Doug MacRay gets close to Claire to know what she might have told to the FBI and they fall in love with each other. Meanwhile, the FBI Special Agent Adam Frawley is assigned to investigate the heists to armored trucks and banks in Charlestown and he concludes that the thieves are the four friends. He joins his team and keeps Doug and his friends under surveillance. Doug decides to move to Florida with Claire and begin a new life; however, the dwellers are trapped in Charlestown and they do not have any way out but dead.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nThe son of a tough Charlestown, MA thief, Doug passed on his chance to walk the straight and narrow in favor of becoming a career bank robber. Not only is Doug\'s crew one of the most ruthless in Boston, but they\'re also one of the best; they never leave a trace of evidence, and always make a clean break. Over the years, Doug\'s fearless partners in crime have become something of a surrogate family to him; Jem (Jeremy Renner), the most dangerous of the bunch, is the closest thing Doug has ever had to a brother. But a divide begins to open between the two career criminals when Jem takes bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage during a particularly tense heist, and the group subsequently discovers that she hails from their own tight-knit suburb. When Jem proposes that the gang make an effort to find out just how much Claire recalls about the crime, Doug fears that his volatile partner may do more harm than good and volunteers himself for the job. Later, Doug turns on the charm while pretending to bump into Claire by chance, and becomes convinced that she doesn\'t suspect him of being the same man who just robbed her bank. As the feds turn up the heat on the gang, Doug finds himself falling for Claire, and searching desperately for a means of cutting his ties to his criminal past. But with each passing day, Jem grows increasingly suspicious of Doug\'s true motivations. Now caught between two worlds with no chance of turning back, Doug realizes that his only hope for finding a happy future is to betray the only family he\'s ever known.', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-13 12:38:53', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 1, 'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nAustria::16\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-15/13\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nIndia::A\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nMalaysia::18\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::R21\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R', 18),

However Mark survives and now has to find ingenious ways to make it till the next scheduled Mars mission fours years later with the remaining meagre supplies.

As conflict erupts in the kingdoms of men, an ancient enemy rises once again to threaten them all. Meanwhile, the last heirs of a recently usurped dynasty plot to take back their homeland from across the Narrow Sea.\r\n-\r\nSam Gray\r\n\r\nYears after a rebellion spurred by a stolen bride to be and the blind ambitions of a mad King, Robert of the house Baratheon (Mark Addy) sits on the much desired Iron Throne. In the mythical land of Westeros, nine noble families fight for every inch of control and every drop of power. The King\'s Hand, Jon Arryn (Sir John Standing), is dead. And Robert seeks out his only other ally in all of Westeros, his childhood friend Lord Eddard \"Ned\" Stark. The solemn and honorable Warden of the North is tasked to depart his frozen sanctuary and join the King in the capital of King\'s Landing to help the now overweight and drunk Robert rule. However, a letter in the dead of night informs \"Ned\" that the former Hand was murdered, and that Robert will be next. So noble Ned goes against his better desires in an attempt to save his friend and the kingdoms. But political intrigue, plots, murders, and sexual desires lead to a secret that could tear the Seven Kingdoms apart. And soon Eddard will find out what happens when you play the Game of Thrones.\r\n-\r\nGregory Tobin\r\n\r\nBased on the best-selling book series \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" by George R.R. Martin, this sprawling HBO drama is set in a world where summers span several decades and winters can last a lifetime. From the scheming south and the savage eastern lands, to the frozen north and ancient Wall that protects the realm from the mysterious darkness beyond, the powerful families of the Seven Kingdoms are locked in a battle for the Iron Throne. This is a story of duplicity and treachery, nobility and honor, conquest and triumph. In the Game of Thrones, you either win or you die.\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan\r\n\r\nNine noble families fight for control of the mythical land of Westeros. Political and sexual intrigue is pervasive. Robert Baratheon (Mark Addy), King of Westeros, asks his old friend, Lord Eddard Stark (Sean Bean), to serve as Hand of the King, or highest official. Secretly warned that the previous Hand was assassinated, Eddard accepts in order of business to investigate further. Meanwhile, Queen Cersei Lannister\'s family may be hatching a plot to take power. Across the sea, the last members of the previous and deposed ruling family, the Targaryens, are also scheming to regain the throne. The friction between the houses Stark, Lannister, Baratheon, and Targaryen and with the remaining great houses Greyjoy, Tully, Arryn, Tyrell, and Martell leads to full-scale war.

He prevents killing the human-demonic half-blood, which was accidentally created and raises this \"Hellboy\", while rising to head of a secret C.I.A.-linked U.S. agency Bureau of Paranormal Research, which secretly studies and uses the occult, including supernatural freaks. As \"father\" Broom is aging, he hand-picks brilliant, sensitive Agent John Myers as new minder-companion, as regular \"warrior\" Agent Clay can\'t empathize and lacks flexibility mental. Hellboy is quite a handful, regularly spotted by worried civilians on unauthorized excursions, especially to pyro-telekinetic freak friend in a mental asylum. Johnny, Hellboy, and Clay team up on missions against paranormal threats with aquatic-bionic freak Abe Sapien. Their task proves to be daunting, as monster Sammael multiplies every time it \"dies\", while Rasputin and the Nazis reemerge, armed for revenge.\r\n-\r\nKGF Vissers\r\n\r\nSpawned in the fiery pits of Hell, humankind\'s unlikely defender--the scarlet-skinned, cigar-chomping, gun-toting, hornless demon with the heart of a human, Hellboy--finds himself battling the same evil forces, nearly sixty years after thwarting Adolf Hitler\'s occult scheme in 1944. As a special member of the top-secret Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defence, led by his father-figure, Trevor Bruttenholm, Hellboy along with his equally exotic brothers-in-arms--the telepathic amphibious man, Abe Sapiens, and the beautiful fire-starter, Liz Sherman--join forces with the FBI agent, John Myers, to avert the plans of the sinister Russian mystic, Grigory Rasputin. Once more, the world\'s future is at stake. Can Hellboy, the infernal hero, save the day?\r\n-\r\nAdolf Hitler\r\n\r\nHellboy isn\'t your average hero. Hell, he isn\'t even your average superhero. Brought forth by the Nazis during a sacred ritual towards the end of World War II. Our hero was summoned by accident when the evil monk of Russian history and folklore, Grigori Rasputin was meddling with forces that lead to his undoing. With the twisted and evil monster trapped for another sixty years when things don\'t go as planned (U.S. soldiers heroically intervened). Hellboy is raised by Professor Trevor \"Broom\" Bruttenholm, an expert in the occult. Our demonic hero is initiated in to the Bureau of Paranormal Research, were he joins the amphibious, kind-hearted, and clever fellow \"freak\", Abe Sapien. When Rasputin returns once again with the aid of his minions, the maniacal, undead assassin Kroenen and the monk\'s faithful lover Ilsa. Hellboy must unwillingly pair up with John Myers, an idealistic, naive new Agent of the Bureau. Not only that, but the big hunk of an evil basher becomes entangled in a love triangle with the pyro-telekinetic love of his life Liz and his new comrade. Fighting evil couldn\'t prove to be more difficult, or out there.\r\n-\r\nrobert-filmfan(robert@mcelwaines.fsnet.co.uk)\r\n\r\nWhen the Nazis attempt to use black magic during the last days of World War II, a monkey-like demon is thrown into the real world. Trevor \"Broom\" Bruttenholm discovers the creature and rescues it from any danger. The creature grows up and goes by the name of \"Hellboy\". Working in secrecy, Hellboy works to rid any evil. When some familiar faces from the past appear, it\'s going to take more than Hellboy to stop them.\r\n-\r\nFilmFanUk', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-13 12:48:22', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 1, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::18+\r\nChile::TE\r\nCzech Republic::U\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-15\r\nFrance::Tous publics avec avertissement\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-12\r\nIceland::14\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::12PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nMalaysia::18PL\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Africa::10\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13', 12),

At first he thinks he\'s hit the jackpot-fame and fortune are his for the taking. That all changes, however, when he meets three witches, Theodora (Mila Kunis), Evanora (Rachel Weisz), and Glinda (Michelle Williams), who are not convinced he is the great wizard everyone\'s been expecting. Reluctantly drawn into the epic problems facing the Land of Oz and its inhabitants, Oscar must find out who is good and who is evil before it is too late. Putting his magical arts to use through illusion, ingenuity-and even a bit of wizardry-Oscar transforms himself not only into the great and powerful Wizard of Oz but into a better man as well.\r\n-\r\nJames Franco\r\n\r\nIn 1905, in Kansas, the small-time circus magician Oscar \"Oz\" Diggs is a weak, greedy, selfish and womanizer conman without character. He gives music boxes to the women that he seduces, and when a strong artist finds that his wife has a box in her belongings, he chases Oz through the circus. Oz flees in a balloon, but a tornado strikes his balloon and he lands on the Land of Oz. Oscar meets the gorgeous Theodora and she believes that he is the powerful magician from an ancient prophecy that will release her land from the Wicked Witch. Theodora tells that her sister and she are good witches, but the Wicked Witch had killed the king. Now the people are waiting for the magician to be their new king after defeating the witch. Theodora is seduced by Oz and brings him to the City of Emerald. When he sees the king\'s treasure, he decides to seek out the Wicked Witch and destroy her magic wand to get rid off her and become the king. Oz meets Glinda, who is supposed to be the Wicked witch, and soon he learns that Theodora\'s sister Evanora is the evil one indeed. Meanwhile Evanora lures he sister that is jealous and uses a spell to turn her into a wicked witch. Oscar learns that he is the only hope for the inhabitants of Oz that believe that he is a powerful magician and his only chance to defeat Evanora and Theodora is using illusion since he has no magic power.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nStranded with his hot air balloon during a wild tempest, Oscar \"Oz\" Diggs, an ambitious and smug magician of a travelling circus, he will eventually land in the mythical Land of Oz. In the streets of the Emerald city, he will encounter many strange creatures as well as the good people of Oz who will all see him as the wizard who was prophesied to save the peaceful land from the clutches of the Wicked Witch. Sooner or later, Oscar will have to use all of his tricks that hides in his sleeves, equal doses of imagination and sensory manipulation by means of theatrical illusion, all topped with a sprinkle of magic to prove without a doubt that he can be indeed the Great Wizard of Oz.\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nShady illusionist Oscar Diggs (James Franco) enchants curious audiences at a Kansas circus. A self-professed con man, he\'s a fast-talking performer who aspires to follow in the footsteps of inventors like Thomas Edison. Oscar is being chased across the circus grounds by the rampaging Strongman when a tornado blows in and everyone runs for cover. Seeing a hot-air balloon as his only chance for escape, the illusionist jumps in and cuts himself free. Magically transported to the wondrous world of Oz, he soon encounters Theodora (Mila Kunis), a temperamental witch who surmises that he is the wizard named after their land (Oscar\'s nickname is Oz), foretold to fall from the sky, defeat a nasty witch, and ascend to the throne. Theodora takes Oscar to the Emerald City to meet her sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz), a powerful witch who reveals that he cannot become the rightful ruler of Oz until he\'s accomplished his mission. Later, as Oscar and his new flying-monkey companion Finley (voice of Zach Braff) prepare to face their fearsome enemy, they\'re joined by the fragile but fearless China Girl (voice of Joey King) and benevolent witch Glinda the Good (Michelle Williams), who help them prepare for the arduous battle ahead. Together with the brave people of Oz, Oscar draws up a plan to rid the land of evil once and for all, and become the great and powerful king who will rule from his throne in the Emerald City.k.', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-13 12:52:23', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::PG\r\nBrazil::Livre\r\nCanada::G\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::6\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-7\r\nMaldives::15+\r\nMexico::A\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::PG\r\nNorway::9\r\nPhilippines::G\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Korea::All\r\nSpain::7\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::8\r\nUnited Kingdom::PG\r\nUnited States::PG', 12),

His two partners could kill off everyone else involved in the robbery, and slowly start to think about climbing up through the hierarchy of the Mob. Henry, however, might be badly affected by his partners\' success, but will he consider stooping low enough to bring about the downfall of Jimmy and Tommy?\r\n-\r\nColin Tinto\r\n\r\nThis film views the mob lives of three pivotal figures in the 1960\'s and 70\'s New York. Henry Hill is a local boy turned gangster in a neighborhood full of the roughest and toughest. Tommy DeVito is a purebred gangster, who turns out to be Henry\'s best friend. Jimmy Conway puts the two of them together, and runs some of the biggest hijacks and burglaries the town has ever seen. After an extended jail sentence, Henry must sneak around the back of the local mob boss, Paulie Cicero, to live the life of luxury he has always dreamed of. In the end, the friends end up in a hell of a jam, and must do anything they can to save each other, and stay alive.\r\n-\r\n\r\nThe story of Irish-Italian American, Henry Hill, and how he lives day-to-day life as a member of the Mafia. Based on a true story, the plot revolves around Henry and his two unstable friends Jimmy and Tommy as they gradually climb the ladder from petty crime to violent murders.\r\n-\r\nGraeme Roy\r\n\r\nThe lowly, blue-collar side of New York\'s Italian mafia is explored in this crime biopic of wiseguy Henry Hill. As he makes his way from strapping young petty criminal, to big-time thief, to middle-aged cocaine addict and dealer, the film explores in detail the rules and traditions of organized crime. Watching the rise and fall of Hill and his two counterparts, the slick jack-of-all-trades criminal Jimmy Conway and the brutish, intimidating Tommy DeVito, this true story realistically explores the core, blue-collar part of the mob.\r\n-\r\nDustin B.', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-13 12:59:36', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::R\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::18A\r\nChile::18\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::16\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::18\r\nIsrael::16\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nJapan::PG-12\r\nMexico::C\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNigeria::15\r\nNorway::18\r\nPeru::18\r\nPhilippines::R-18\r\nPoland::18\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::18\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nUnited Kingdom::18\r\nUnited States::R', 12),

Desmond then saves the life of a worker, experiencing a wholesome satisfaction in the process. In the hospital, he is smitten by a nurse, who he then dates. After the United States enters the Second World War, both sons enlist, adding to the ire of the father who despises his sons joining the Army. The rigorous regimen of training in the Army requires Desmond to clear his firearms training, but after a huge tiff with his seniors, his father, an old corporal, intervenes to save Desmond from being court-martialed and serve with the Army as a medic. They get posted to Hacksaw Ridge, Okinawa. A win there would ensure that the Empire of Japan surrenders to the Allied Forces. What happens thereon?\r\n-\r\nPipingHotViews\r\n\r\nAfter Desmond T. Doss volunteered to enlist in the US Army in WWII, he was firstly assumed as a cowardice for anti-killing stance performing as a Medic. This is how Private Doss inspired us about an incredible-bravery-true story on Hacksaw Ridge at the Battle of Okinawa.The most inspired part of this film is the scene when Doss whispered, \" Lord, help me get one more, please. Help me get one more.\"\r\n-\r\nDesmond T. Doss\r\n\r\nIn Lynchburg, Desmond Doss and his brother Hal are raised by a dysfunctional family since their father Tom Doss is an alcoholic veteran of World War I that beats their mother Bertha. One day, Desmond almost kills Hal and his life is affected by the Commandment \"Thou shalt not kill\". Years later, he meets the nurse Dorothy Schutte and they fall in love with each other. Desmond, who is Seventh-day Adventist Christian and conscientious objector, decides to join the army to serve his country in World War II; however he refuses to carry or use any weapon and requests to serve as combat medic to save lives. He faces several problems during the training and but he succeeds to go to the war to participate in the Battle of Okinawa. Will he be helpful in the battle field?\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary true story of conscientious objector Desmond T. Doss who saved 75 men in Okinawa, during the bloodiest battle of WWII, without firing a single shot. Believing that the war was just but killing was nevertheless wrong, he was the only American soldier in WWII to fight on the front lines without a weapon. As an army medic Doss single-handedly evacuated the wounded near enemy lines - braving enemy fire and putting his own life on the line. He was the first conscientious objector to ever earn the Congressional Medal of Honor.\r\n-\r\nDesmond T. Doss\r\n\r\nWhile his fellow Virginians volunteer for the US Army, pacifist Bible biter Desmond Doss has a moral dilemma, willing to serve but not to kill. Recruited an such false promise, he sticks to his pious plan to serve country and fellow men as medic, unwilling to touch a gun and suffering any abuse without accepting to be dishonorable discharged from boot camp which looks like a psych ward, complete with nudist macho \'Hollywood\'. His abusive father, a Great War veteran, pulls a marker to have a general turn his court martial into permission to serve as stretcher bearer. Their regiment lands on the strategic Okinawa island, an exceptionally bloody battle against the fearless Japanese. Waves of men are sent up a steep cliff and against a wall of Japanese fire, suffering extreme casualties and forced to retreat anyway. Desmond probes his courage and unwavering trust in God by treating and rescuing wounded, on his back or dragging them trough fire, hiding for enemy sorties, even returning on his own to sneak out badly bleeding mates he lowers from the cliff with herculean effort despite his own wounds, setting a record most worthy of the Congressional Medal of Honor without touching a single bullet.\r\n-\r\nKGF Vissers', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-13 13:01:00', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 1, 'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nAustria::16\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::18\r\nIndia::A\r\nIreland::15\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::18\r\nMalta::15\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R15\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::R-16\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Africa::18\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nTaiwan::R-15\r\nThailand::15\r\nTurkey::15+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R', 18),

Vastly outnumbered, the Greeks held back the enemy in one of the most famous last stands of history. Persian King Xerxes led a Army of well over 100,000 (Persian king Xerxes before war has about 170,000 army) men to Greece and was confronted by 300 Spartans, 700 Thespians, and 400 Thebans. Xerxes waited for 10 days for King Leonidas to surrender or withdraw but left with no options he pushed forward. After 3 days of battle all the Greeks were killed. The Spartan defeat was not the one expected, as a local shepherd, named Ephialtes, defected to the Persians and informed Xerxes that the separate path through Thermopylae, which the Persians could use to outflank the Greeks, was not as heavily guarded as they thought.\r\n-\r\ncyberian2005\r\n\r\n300 tells the story of the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C. Persians under the rule of King Xerxes have already taken over some of the Hellenic city-states, and now threaten Sparta and Athens. King Leonidas of Sparta is left with two options: he will either have to sacrifice himself for the well-being of Sparta or watch it burn to the ground. Choosing the former, Leonidas forms an army of 300 Spartan warriors to block the narrow passage of Thermopylae where Xerxes intends to reach Hellas. The 300 are accompanied by about 700 Thespians who protect the flanks of the passage, and combined, the forces manage to slay tens of thousands of Persians and prevent their entry into Hellas for several days. However, Ephialtes, a reject of the Spartan Army gets his revenge by showing Xerxes a secret goat passage up the flanks of the passage. The story depicts the epic last stand of the finest Spartan soldiers who are aware of their fate, but motivated by \"honor and glory\", see the battle as their duty to protect the rest of Greece for as long as possible.\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan\r\n\r\nIn 480 BC, the Persian king Xerxes sends his massive army to conquer Greece. The Greek city of Sparta houses its finest warriors, and 300 of these soldiers are chosen to meet the Persians at Thermopylae, engaging the soldiers in a narrow canyon where they cannot take full advantage of their numbers. The battle is a suicide mission, meant to buy time for the rest of the Greek forces to prepare for the invasion. However, that doesn\'t stop the Spartans from throwing their hearts into the fray, determined to take as many Persians as possible with them.\r\n-\r\nrmlohner\r\n\r\nWhen the ambitious King Xerxes of Persia invades Greece with his huge army to extend his vast slave empire, the brave King Leonidas brings his personal body guard army composed of three hundred warriors to defend the passage of Thermopylae, the only way by land to reach Greece. Using courage and the great battle skill of his men, he defends Thermopylae until a treacherous Greek citizen tells King Xerxes a secret goat passage leading to the back of Leonidas\'s army. Meanwhile, his wife Queen Gorgo of Sparta tries to convince the council to send the Spartan army to fight against the Persians.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-14 06:39:52', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nAustria::16\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::14\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIran::(Banned)\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::R-15\r\nMalaysia::18PL\r\nMexico::C\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::18\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUkraine::16', 18),

As he suffers from insomnia, he spends his time working as a taxi driver at night, watching porn movies at seedy cinemas during the day, or thinking about how the world, New York in particular, has deteriorated into a cesspool. He\'s a loner who has strong opinions about what is right and wrong with mankind. For him, the one bright spot in New York humanity is Betsy, a worker on the presidential nomination campaign of Senator Charles Palantine. He becomes obsessed with her. After an incident with her, he believes he has to do whatever he needs to make the world a better place in his opinion.

He invites Betsy to drink coffee with him and later he dates her. However he takes her to see a porn Swedish movie and she feels offended and leaves him. Travis unsuccessfully sends flowers for her but she rejects him. Travis meets the young prostitute Iris that is trying to flee from her pimp Sport in his taxi but Sport takes her from the car.

Travis is fed up with the society he finds himself surrounded by, wishing that a \"real rain will come and wash all the scum off the streets\". But Travis\'s personality sees him being unable to connect with virtually anyone, until he becomes infatuated with a blonde campaign worker named Betsy and then later meets an adolescent prostitute named Iris. As Travis grows increasingly more paranoid of his situations, he begins to sees these relationships he develops as \'missions\' of which he will need to be the saviour.\r\n-\r\nKyle Perez\r\n\r\nIn the shadow of bustling Big Apple, Travis Bickle--a depressed former U.S. Marine and a chronically insomniac lone wolf--prowls the night streets of the metropolis\' dark underbelly in his yellow cab. A nobody amid nobodies against the backdrop of an increasingly distorted perceived reality, Travis delves deeper and deeper into his world of obsession and vitriolic revulsion, as an endless string of bitter rejections from unobtainable objects of desire; condemned young souls, and even his colleagues, can only lead to a flaming manifesto of violence. Now, as Travis braces up to clean up this filthy city, his hungry and lethal weapons will become the grim messengers of truth. His truth.\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nNew York City taxi driver Travis Bickle constantly, almost obsessively, reflects on the ugly corruption of life around him, and becomes increasingly disturbed over his own loneliness and alienation. In nearly every phase of his life, he remains a complete outsider, failing to make emotional contact with anyone.

With the help of her friends, Alice must travel through time to save the Mad Hatter and Underland\'s fate from the evil clutches of the Red Queen and a clock like creature, known as Time.\r\n-\r\nGhostface\r\n\r\nAlice is back in Wonderland - but this time it was not an accident. She is on a quest to go back in time and rescue the Mad Hatter\'s family, but in order to do so she needs the Chronosphere - a device that enables time travel which only the human manifestation of time itself, Time has. As she journeys through time in a thrilling and dangerous adventure she learns more about why the Red Queen and the White Queen don\'t get along, and the actual truth about the Mad Hatter\'s family, but little does Alice know that you shouldn\'t try to change the past, but rather learn from it.\r\n-\r\nkhalidaun\r\n\r\nAlice has just returned from an adventure in which she captained a ship to China and back. She now discovers that Hamish, her former fiance, has taken advantage of Alice\'s mother\'s poor financial situation, forced her to either lose her house or Alice\'s ship. To escape the situation with Hamish, Alice follows Absolem, a talking bug, through the mirror into another world, a world she is rather familiar with. There she finds old friends like the Mad Hatter, White Queen, Tweedledum and Tweedledee and the Cheshire Cat. The Mad Hatter is in a poor state, pining for his family who died several years ago. To correct this, Alice meets Time, and steals his most valuable possession. This brings her into contact, and conflict, yet again with the irascible, insane Red Queen.\r\n-\r\ngrantss\r\n\r\nAlice Kingsleigh has spent the past three years following in her father\'s footsteps and sailing the high seas. Upon her return to London from China, she learns her ex-fiance, Hamish Ascot, has taken over his father\'s company and plans to have Alice sell him over her father\'s ship in exchange for her family home. Alice follows a butterfly she recognizes as Absolem and returns to Wonderland through a mirror. Alice is greeted by the White Queen, the White Rabbit, the Tweedles, the Dormouse, the March Hare, Bayard and the Cheshire Cat. They inform her that the Mad Hatter, Tarrant Hightopp, is acting madder than usual because his family is missing. Alice tries to console him, but the Mad Hatter remains sure of his family\'s survival of the Attack of the Jabberwocky day..\r\n\r\nAlmost robbed of everything, the intrepid captain, Alice Kingsleigh, finds herself before a pressing dilemma; however, much to her surprise, a mysterious blue trail and an enchanted looking glass will swiftly transport her back to the colourful realm of Underland. There, an ailing Hatter who longs for his long-gone family believes that they are still alive somewhere--and, to further complicate matters--his loyal companions are unable to help. Has the once-cheerful hat-maker truly gone mad? Now, only time and Alice can solve this intricate conundrum, racing against a shrewd old adversary who closely watches her every move. Can the flaxen-haired outsider save her friend from madness, and, God forbid, from an untimely demise?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-14 10:18:09', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::PG\r\nBrazil::Livre\r\nCanada::PG\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::6\r\nGreece::K-10\r\nHong Kong::I\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::10\r\nIndia::U\r\nIndonesia::13+\r\nIreland::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-7\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMaldives::12+\r\nMexico::A\r\nNetherlands::9\r\nNew Zealand::PG\r\nNorway::9\r\nPhilippines::G\r\nPoland::7\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Africa::7-9\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::A/i\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::8\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nThailand::G\r\nUnited Kingdom::PG\r\nUnited States::PG\r\nUkraine::ZA\r\nVietnam::P', 0),

Found by the mysterious Dr. Ido while trolling for cyborg parts, Alita becomes a lethal, dangerous being. She cannot remember who she is, or where she came from. But to Dr. Ido, the truth is all too clear. She is the one being who can break the cycle of death and destruction left behind from Tiphares. But to accomplish her true purpose, she must fight and kill. And that is where Alita\'s true significance comes to bear. She is an angel from heaven. She is an angel of death.\r\n-\r\nAnthony Harmon\r\n\r\nIn 2563, three hundred years after the war \"The Fall\", the mysterious scientist Dr. Dyson Ido finds part of a female cyborg in a junkyard and brings to his laboratory. He finds that her human brain is amnetic but intact and gives the name of his deceased daughter Alita to the cyborg. Alita meets on the street Dr. Ido\'s ex-wife Chiren, who is also a scientist that works to the powerful Zapan, and befriends the young Hugo, who brings cyborg\'s parts to Dr. Ido, and learns that both dream on moving to the floating city of Zalem. Hugo teaches Alita how to play Motorball and she learns that the champion of the Motorball Tournament moves to Zalem. Soon Alita discovers that Dr. Ido is a hunter warrior and after finding her cyborg body in a crashed spaceship, she decides to become also a hunter warrior but Dr. Ido refuses to replace her body. Who was Alita and what is the secret of the cyborg body found by Alita?Let us see what happens.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nSet in the 26th century, the story takes place 300 years after a societal collapse caused by a major war. In that society, it\'s a technological dark age following a pinnacle of achievement far beyond where we are right now. Cyborg technology is a way of life. People are augmented a lot as workers, so being a cyborg is not unusual. The main character is a cyborg. She has an organic human brain, and she looks like she\'s about fourteen years old. She has a completely artificial body and she\'s lost her memory. She is found in a wreckage and reconstituted by a cyber-surgeon who becomes her surrogate father.\r\n-\r\nTermlnatriX\r\n\r\nWhen Alita (Rosa Salazar) awakens with no memory of who she is in a future world she does not recognize, she is taken in by Dr. Ido (Christoph Waltz), a compassionate doctor who realizes that somewhere in this abandoned cyborg shell is the heart and soul of a young woman with an extraordinary past. As Alita learns to navigate her new life and the treacherous streets of Iron City, Ido tries to shield her from her mysterious history while her street-smart new friend Hugo (Keean Johnson) offers instead to help trigger her memories. But it is only when the deadly and corrupt forces that run the city come after Alita that she discovers a clue to her past - she has unique fighting abilities that those in power will stop at nothing to control. If she can stay out of their grasp, she could be the key to saving her friends, her family and the world she\'s grown to love.\r\n-\r\nTwentieth Century Fox', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-14 10:19:26', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBelgium::KT/EA\r\nBrazil::14\r\nBulgaria::C\r\nCanada::14A\r\nChile::14\r\nColombia::12\r\nCzech Republic::12\r\nDenmark::11\r\nEcuador::12\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics avec avertissement\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::13+\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nLuxembourg::12\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMaldives::15+\r\nMalta::12A\r\nMexico::B\r\nMongolia::PG\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNigeria::15\r\nNorway::12\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nPuerto Rico::PG-13\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSerbia::12\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSlovakia::12\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nThailand::15\r\nTurkey::15A\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUkraine::12\r\nVietnam::C16', 12),

General Brigham plans an attack to France expecting to defeat the Mimics and orders Major William Cage, who is an American public relation officer, to cover the invasion. However Cage does not accept the assignment and threatens General Brigham to expose the casualties. He is arrested, accused of desertion, demoted to private and assigned to fight in the invasion under the command of the tough Sergeant Farell in the Heathrow Base. Humans are slaughtered in the invasion and Cage kills a Mimic and is sprayed by his blood; in less than five minutes combat, Cage dies. Surprisingly he awakes in the Heathrow Base and relives the same day over and over after dieing. Each time, Cage tries to fix the deaths of his squad and he meets Sergeant Rita Vrataski who asks him to find her when he awakes in the base. Rita brings Cage to meet Dr. Carter who explains to him that he killed an Alpha and his blood has given the ability to reset time. Further, the last hope of earth is the destruction of the Mimic leader, referred to as the Omega, who is hidden. Will Cage and Rita succeed in their solitary mission?\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nBefore the numbing technological superiority of the omnipotent extraterrestrial menace known only as the \"Mimics\", mankind stands helpless, doomed to accept an ignoble fate. Having harnessed an unfathomable ability, the hordes of the ferocious alien race are practically invincible; unless we, humans, come up with an unexpected and drastic counter-attack. When the unseasoned officer, Major William Cage, learns firsthand the magnitude of the problem with his own life, he quickly realises that death is only the beginning--each blood-drenched battle with the formidable foes brings him back to square one, only with a dash of improvement in his fighting capacity. Perhaps now, Cage, his legendary brother-in-arms, Rita Vrataski, and the rest of the world have a fighting chance against the otherworldly opponent. Can we solve the enemy\'s enigma?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-14 10:20:15', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::G\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::11\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::10-12\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nThailand::G\r\nTurkey::13A\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13', 12),

President Snow visits Katniss to threaten the lives of everyone she knows and holds dear if she doesn\'t do all she can to toe the line and quell the unrest. As her best efforts fail, Plutarch Heavensbee (a former games-master, now returned) meets with Snow to implement a Quarter Quell, by which to gather all former Hunger Game victors and have them eliminate each other. Katniss and Peeta end up in the Quarter Quell but must form alliances in order to survive; however, those with whom Katniss prefers to ally herself seem to be for emotional rather than tactical reasons.\r\n-\r\nstatmanjeff\r\n\r\nAfter defying the Capitol on national television, Katniss has to attempt to control an uprising stirring in the districts. When President Snow puts her family and friends in jeopardy Katniss knows she has no choice but to follow Snow\'s orders.

Katniss plans to sacrifice her own life to save Peeta\'s.\r\n-\r\nmolly-field\r\n\r\nAfter narrowly escaping the 74th Hunger Games, Peeta and Katniss are chosen once again to compete in the Hunger Games, this time in the Quarter Quell--the 25th annual Games.

Hoping to put an end to the growing threat of rebellion, President Snow announces that the Quell\'s tributes will be reaped from the existing pool of victors -- guaranteeing Katniss a place in the arena.

He assembles a team, not realizing her real goal is a safe-deposit box with compromising photos of a royal: she needs the photos to trade for avoiding a jail sentence - and MI-5, or is it MI-6, is pulling the strings two steps removed. A Trinidadian thug, a high-end bordello owner, and a pornographer also have things stored in the vault, so the break-in threatens many a powerful personage. Is there any way these amateurs can pull it off?\r\n-\r\n\r\nIn 1971, criminal Michael X blackmails the British government with compromising photos of members of parliament practicing kinky sex with prostitutes. He keeps the photos in a safe deposit box in the Lloyds Bank at Baker Street. The ambitious MI-5 Federal Agent Tim Everett plots a bold plan to retrieve the pictures in a heist of the bank. He arrests former model Martine Love in the airport trafficking drugs and offers security information to her to facilitate to rob of the bank. Martine goes to East London and meets her former lover, car dealer Terry Leather, who is married with two daughters but owes money to a dangerous loan shark, and tells him that the bank\'s alarm will be deactivated during a few days. Terry summons his friends and the team of amateurs succeeds in the heist. However, together with the money, the gang also steels the photos of Michael X; the book with the transactions with dirty cops of the Scotland Yard and the pornographer Lew Vogel; and photos of politicians in the Sonia Bern\'s brothel. Now different groups organize a manhunt to Terry and his friends with different objectives.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nBased on the true story of the 1971 Baker Street bank robbery which was hushed up at the time by of a Government gagging order.

None of it was recovered. Nobody was ever arrested. The robbery made headlines for a few days and then disappeared - the result of a \'D\' Notice, gagging the press.

In 2019, a former Police Officer is hired to hunt down a fugitive group of replicants living undercover in Los Angeles, California.\r\n-\r\nMadMovieManiac\r\n\r\nIn the early twenty-first century, the Tyrell Corporation, during what was called the Nexus phase, developed robots, called \"replicants\", that were supposed to aid society, the replicants which looked and acted like humans. When the superhuman generation Nexus 6 replicants, used for dangerous off-Earth endeavors, began a mutiny on an off-Earth colony, replicants became illegal on Earth. Police units, called \"blade runners\", have the job of destroying - or in their parlance \"retiring\" - any replicant that makes its way back to or created on Earth, with anyone convicted of aiding or assisting a replicant being sentenced to death. It\'s now November, 2019 in Los Angeles, California. Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), a former blade runner, is called out of retirement when four known replicants, most combat models, have made their way back to Earth, with their leader being Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer). One, Leon Kowalski (Brion James), tried to infiltrate his way into the Tyrell Corporation as an employee, but has since been able to escape. Beyond following Leon\'s trail in hopes of finding and retiring them all, Deckard believes part of what will help him is figuring out what the replicants wanted with the Tyrell Corporation in trying to infiltrate it. The answer may lie with Tyrell\'s fail-safe backup mechanism. Beyond tracking the four, Deckard faces a possible dilemma in encountering a fifth replicant: Rachael (Sean Young), who works as Tyrell\'s assistant. The issue is that Dr. Elden Tyrell (Joe Turkel) is experimenting with her, to provide her with fake memories so as to be able to better control her. With those memories, Rachael has no idea that she is not human. The problem is not only Rachael\'s assistance to Deckard, but that he is beginning to develop feelings for her.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nIn a cyberpunk vision of the future, man has developed the technology to create replicants - humanoid androids with short, fixed lifespans - which are illegal on Earth, but are used in the off-world colonies. In Los Angeles, California, 2019, Deckard is a \"blade runner\", a cop who specializes in terminating replicants. He is forced to come out of retirement when four replicants escape from an off-world colony and come to Earth.\r\n-\r\nGraeme Roy\r\n\r\nLos Angeles, California, 2019: Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) of the L.A.P.D.\'s Blade Runner unit prowls the steel and microchip jungle of the twenty-first century for assumed humanoids known as \"replicants\". Replicants were declared illegal after a bloody mutiny on an off-world colony, and are to be terminated upon detection. Man\'s obsession with creating a being equal to himself has backfired.\r\n-\r\nMatt McQuillan\r\n\r\nRick Deckard (Harrison Ford), a Policeman of the future, hunts down and terminates replicants, artificially created humans. He wants to get out of the force, but is drawn back in when four \"skin jobs\", a slang term for replicants, hijack a ship back to Earth. The city in which Deckard must search for his prey is a huge, sprawling, bleak vision of the future.

Little by little, as \"K\" tries to put the pieces together, he comes to realise that one man is the key element that binds everything together in this mystery: the retired Blade Runner, Rick Deckard, who has either disappeared or gone underground.

With a strong survival instinct, he has made himself a key player in the business of conflict diamonds. Political unrest is rampant in Sierra Leone as people fight tooth for tooth. Upon meeting Solomon, and the beautiful Maddy, Archer\'s life changes forever as he is given a chance to make peace with the war around him.\r\n-\r\nMiist\r\n\r\nIn 1999, in Sierra Leone, the fisherman Solomon Vandy dreams on the day that his young son Dia Vandy will become a doctor. His dreams are shattered when the rebels invade his village and kidnap him to work in the diamond mines. Solomon finds a huge pink diamond and while hiding it, the commandant of the rebels sees, but the rebels are attacked and Salomon is arrested by the government army. While in jail, the wounded commandant tell the prisoners that Salomon found the stone, and the mercenary smuggler Danny Archer from Zimbabwe releases Salomon and proposes to exchange the diamond by his missing family. Using the idealistic American journalist Maddy Bowen, Danny locates the wife and daughters of Salomon in a refugee camp, but is informed that his son has been recruited by the rebels. Salomon and Danny consolidate a partnership, with Salomon looking for and finding his son, and Danny looking for the diamond and finding redemption.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nSet against the backdrop of civil war and chaos in 1990\'s Sierra Leone, Blood Diamond is the story of Danny Archer - an ex mercenary from Zimbabwe - and Solomon Vandy - a Mende fisherman. Both men are African, but their histories as different as any can be, until their fates become joined in a common quest to recover a rare pink diamond that can transform their lives. While in prison for smuggling, Archer learns that Solomon - who was taken from his family and forced to work in the diamond fields - has found and hidden the extraordinary rough stone. With the help of Maddy Bowen, an American journalist whose idealism is tempered by a deepening connection with Archer, the two men embark on a trek through rebel territory, a journey that could save Solomon\'s family and give Archer the second chance he thought he would never have.\r\n-\r\nProduction', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-14 10:32:47', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 1, 'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nAustria::14\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::TE\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-15\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nIndia::A\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nMalaysia::18PL\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nSingapore::NC-16\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::18\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R', 18),

He finds solace in a unique book which he carries on his person and guards closely, while surviving by hunting small animals and seeking goods in destroyed houses and vehicles to trade in villages for water and supplies. When he reaches a village ruled by the powerful mobster, Carnegie (Gary Oldman), the man views Eli\'s impressive fighting skills and offers Eli a place within his gang. Carnegie presses his blind lover Claudia (Jennifer Beals) to send her daughter, Solara (Mila Kunis), to at least convince Eli to spend the night by sleeping with him. However, Eli proves to be the better man when he gently declines her advances. The girl sees Eli\'s book, and when Carnegie finds out he beats her mother until she reveals what she saw.

But Merida chooses to defy her mother. And when she and her mother have an argument, Merida rides off and meets a witch. She asks for a spell to change her mother. And the witch gives her a cake which she gives to her mother, but the change is not what she was hoping for. So she tries to find a way to fix it.\r\n-\r\nrcs0411@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nMerida (Kelly Macdonald), a redheaded Princess who lives in a castle located in Scotland. Her mother, Elinor (Dame Emma Thompson) is an elegant Queen who is trying to teach Merida to be a true Princess, but she doesn\'t want to. Merida gets so fed up that she runs into a witch hut and she creates a spell pastry to give to Elinor. After she eats it, she becomes a hideous beast and Merida must save her mother from staying like this beast forever. All Merida wanted was to be free, and have her mother stop being so controlling. Can she save her mother or will Elinor stay as this beast permanently?\r\n\r\nPrincess Merida (Kelly Macdonald), the impetuous, but courageous, daughter of Scottish King Fergus (Sir Billy Connolly) and Queen Elinor (Dame Emma Thompson), is a skilled archer who wants to carve out her own path in life. Her defiance of an age-old tradition angers the Highland Lords and leads to chaos in the kingdom. Merida seeks help from an eccentric witch, who grants her an ill-fated wish.

As a result, the rebellious and headstrong Merida, who has none of her mother\'s attempts to arrange an unwelcome betrothal, will flee the castle in a fit of rage, only to enter the enchanted dark forest - home of a powerful and devious local witch. Unwisely, the desperate girl hopes that a potent magical incantation may be the solution to her problems. However, to change one\'s destiny, one must first change what\'s inside him or her.

But not everything goes to plan within the factory.\r\n-\r\nFilmFanUK\r\n\r\nDreaming of seeing the inside of the exceptional chocolatier Willy Wonka\'s intriguing candy factory, more than anything else, the impecunious but honest boy with a heart of gold, Charlie Bucket, yearns to get the chance to meet his idol in person. Before long, a worldwide contest organised by Willy himself will set the stage for the adventure of a lifetime, as the world\'s greatest chocolate-maker announces that the fortunate boy or girl who comes up with one of out of five rare golden passes hidden in his famous and scrumptious Wonka Bars, will win a free tour of the factory, and a lifetime supply of chocolate. By some miracle, Charlie, who only has enough money to buy one chocolate bar a year, finds the last fifth ticket, and, alongside with his beloved Grandpa Joe, and four other equally lucky children and their chaperones, set foot in cryptic Willy Wonka\'s remarkable world of chocolate. Of course, only one kid gets to win the grand prize. Can Charlie pass Wonka\'s final test?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nCharlie Bucket comes from a poor family, and spends most of his time dreaming about the chocolate that he loves but usually can\'t afford. Things change when Willy Wonka, head of the very popular Wonka Chocolate empire, announces a contest in which five gold tickets have been hidden in chocolate bars and sent throughout the country. The kids who find the tickets will be taken on a tour of Wonka\'s chocolate factory and get a special glimpse of the wonders within. Charlie miraculously finds a ticket, along with four other children much naughtier than him. The tour of the factory will hold more than a few surprises for this bunch.\r\n-\r\nrmlohner\r\n\r\nCharlie Bucket is a young boy who comes from a poor but loving family and would love nothing more than to find a golden ticket to enter the amazing chocolate factory run by inventor and owner Willy Wonka. As luck would have it, Charlie finds the last golden ticket and goes on this once-in-a-lifetime adventure with his grandpa Joe. Among the other four winners are Veruca Salt, a spoiled rich girl; Augustus Gloop, a gluttonous kid who stuffs his face with sweets; Violet Beuragarde, a champion trophy gum chewer; and Mike Teavee, a kid who spends more time watching TV and playing video games than anything else. Most fascinating is the mysterious Willy Wonka who in turn had a troubled childhood and has a special grand prize at the end for one of the kids. Also along the tour are Wonka\'s staff the singing, working Oommpa Loompas.\r\n-\r\nvan_whistler@hotmail.co.uk', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-14 10:37:07', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 1, 'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::PG\r\nBelgium::KT/EA\r\nBrazil::Livre\r\nCanada::G\r\nCzech Republic::12\r\nDenmark::7\r\nFinland::K-7\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::0\r\nGreece::K-8\r\nHong Kong::I\r\nIceland::L\r\nIndia::U\r\nIreland::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::A\r\nNetherlands::6\r\nNew Zealand::PG\r\nNorway::7\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::G\r\nPortugal::M/6\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Africa::PG\r\nSouth Korea::All\r\nSpain::A\r\nSweden::Btl\r\nSwitzerland::8\r\nTaiwan::GP\r\nUnited Kingdom::PG\r\nUnited States::PG', 0),

Then Dr. Schultz tells that he is a bounty hunter chasing John, Ellis and Roger Brittle and proposes a deal to Django: if he helps him, he would give his freedom, a horse and US$ 75.00 for him. Django accepts the deal and Dr. Schultz trains him to be his deputy. They kill the brothers in Daughtray and Django tells that he would use the money to buy the freedom of his wife Broomhilda, who is a slave that speaks German. Dr. Schultz proposes another deal to Django: if he teams-up with him during the winter, he would give one-third of the rewards and help him to rescue Broomhilda. Django accepts his new deal and they become friends. After the winter, Dr. Schultz goes to Gatlinburgh and learns that Broomhilda was sold to the ruthless Calvin Candie von Shaft, who lives in the Candyland Farm, in Mississippi. Dr. Schultz plots a scheme with Django to lure Calvin and rescue Broomhilda from him.

Afterwards, Django sets out with help from Schultz to find and rescue his wife Broomhilda who like him was sold into slavery by an anonymous owner. Their journey takes them to a plantation called Candieland, owned by a ruthless tycoon. Also, they come to some suspicions of the head slave named Stephen.\r\n-\r\nBlazer346\r\n\r\nTwo years before the Civil War pits brother-against-brother, German-born fugitive hunter Dr. King Schultz (Academy Award-winner Christoph Waltz) arrives in America determined to capture the outlaw Brittle brothers dead or alive. In the midst of his search, Dr. Schultz crosses paths with Django (Academy Award-winner Jamie Foxx), a freed slave and skilled tracker who seeks to rescue his beloved wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from ruthless plantation owner Calvin Candie (Academy Award-nominee Leonardo DiCaprio). Once Django has aided Dr. Schultz in coral ling the Brittle brothers, the two team up to capture some of the most wanted men in the South. Meanwhile, Django never loses sight of his mission to free Broomhilda from the treacherous slave trade before it\'s too late. Upon arriving at Candie\'s nefarious plantation, dubbed Candyland, Django and Dr. Schultz discover that slaves are being groomed for gladiator-like competitions by Candie\'s malevolent right-hand man Billy Crash (Walton Goggins), and together they skillfully work their way onto the compound for a closer look. But just as Django and his partner locate Broomhilda and plot a daring escape, Candie\'s house slave Stephen (Academy Award-nominee Samuel L.

As the enemy forces close in, it seems the troops have nowhere to go, but help is at hand and a fierce battle ensues.\r\n-\r\nDik Nolan\r\n\r\nMay/June 1940. Four hundred thousand British and French soldiers are hole up in the French port town of Dunkirk. The only way out is via sea, and the Germans have air superiority, bombing the British soldiers and ships without much opposition. The situation looks dire and, in desperation, Britain sends civilian boats in addition to its hard-pressed Navy to try to evacuate the beleaguered forces. This is that story, seen through the eyes of a soldier amongst those trapped forces, two Royal Air Force fighter pilots, and a group of civilians on their boat, part of the evacuation fleet.\r\n-\r\ngrantss\r\n\r\nWorld War II. The enemy forces have cornered four hundred thousand British and French soldiers on the French coast at Dunkirk. A small number of primarily-French soldiers are guarding the perimeter, where the British and French soldiers are amassed, which is getting increasingly smaller as enemy forces advance. Most of those British and French soldiers are now on the beach waiting for destroyers to come and take them back to Britain. Each of the countries are taking care of their own. The British are leaving first and among those the wounded get first priority despite their taking up seven times the space of the able-bodied soldiers. An issue with Dunkirk is that there is only one dock the destroyers can access, which needs to be protected from the enemy bombs. As such, Churchill, newly elected, has put out a call for civilian watercraft to head to Dunkirk both to transport supplies and to transport soldiers from the beach to the destroyers or back to Britain if at all possible. Within this situation, four general stories are told. In one, Commander Bolton, the top British Naval officer on the ground, knows deep in his heart that the soldiers are largely sitting ducks on the beach as the enemy planes fly over. He knows that the situation is a catch-22 for the British in that they need to bring as many soldiers safely home as possible at the depletion of their military resources, which in turn they need to preserve for the day if, but more likely when, the enemies make their way onto British soil. In the second story, a squadron of three Royal Air Force Spitfires are amongst those limited air resources that are embarking in dog fights with enemy planes, while protecting the soldiers on the ground. In the process, they have to ensure their own safety in order to provide what is needed for the ground soldiers, which includes knowing about things like fuel levels and having enough to make their way back to home base whenever required. In the third story, two soldiers meet on the beach, the two of them knowing that the longer they remain on the beach, the likelier they are not to survive this skirmish. As such, they try to do whatever they need to to make it onto one of those destroyers or any other watercraft making its way back to Britain. However, making it aboard a ship does not necessarily ensure their survival, and in the final story, Mr. Dawson, his young-adult son Peter, and their seventeen-year-old friend George are on Dawson\'s pleasure craft making its way to Dunkirk to do their part in the war effort, all realizing the dangers involved. They have to decide at each step along the way if they will focus on personal problems or if they will continue on to assist in the war, as was their first priority when they left Britain.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nIn May 1940, Germany advanced into France, trapping Allied troops on the beaches of Dunkirk. Under air and ground cover from British and French forces, troops were slowly and methodically evacuated from the beach using every serviceable Naval and civilian vessel that could be found. At the end of this heroic mission, three hundred thirty thousand French, British, Belgian, and Dutch soldiers were safely evacuated.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nIn 1940, during the Battle of France, four hundred thousand Allied soldiers have retreated to Dunkirk. Tommy, a young British private, is the sole survivor of a German ambush. At the beach, he finds thousands of troops awaiting evacuation and meets Gibson, who is burying a body. After a German dive-bomber attack, they find a wounded man. They rush his stretcher onto a hospital ship, hoping to remain aboard, but are ordered off. The ship is sunk by dive bombers; Tommy helps another soldier, Alex, out of the water. They leave at night on a destroyer, but it is sunk by a U-boat. Gibson saves Tommy and Alex from the sinking ship, and they get back to the beach. With only a single, vulnerable mole available for mooring deep-draft ships, the Royal Navy requisitions civilian vessels in the U.K. that can get to the beach. In Weymouth, a civilian sailor Dawson and his son Peter set out on his boat Moonstone, rather than let the Navy commandeer her. Impulsively, Peter\'s teenage friend George joins them. At sea, they rescue a shivering shell-shocked soldier from a wrecked ship. When he realizes that Dawson is sailing for Dunkirk, the soldier demands that they turn back and tries to wrest control of the boat. In the struggle, George falls and suffers a head injury that renders him blind.

Christian dates Ana and offers a non-disclosure agreement to her to keep in secret their relationship.

However, Grey\'s unexpected offer leads to an unusual agreement, one that will lure the incurably romantic woman into his well-hidden world. Now, little by little, Christian entices Anastasia into a sensual reality, seducing her to explore her limits in an unrestrained passion, and tempting her to embrace the cathartic feeling of being different. Above all, Anastasia wants to mend Christian\'s broken heart; nevertheless, for love\'s salted wounds, there are no safe words.\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nBig screen version of the initial book in the series, Fifty Shades of Grey, stars Dakota Johnson as Anastasia Steele, an English Lit major on the verge of graduation when her best friend, a journalism major, gets sick and asks Anastasia to do an assignment for her interview Christian Grey \"Jamie Dornan\", the wealthy businessman who is speaking at their impending graduation ceremony.

It\'s been three years since civilization came to an end, and the loneliness has taken a devastating toll on Neville. By day, he scours the city for food and supplies while sending out desperate radio messages in hopes that someone might respond, and by night, he attempts to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus by experimenting with his own blood. But time is running out for Neville as the legions of infected watch his every move from the safety of the shadows, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

After successfully protecting the planet for three years, something is starting to go wrong. Two estranged brothers are tasked with solving the program\'s malfunction before a world wide Geostorm can engulf the planet.\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to save the planet from the devastating effects of the extreme climate change, an eminent team of scientists led by Jake Lawson, manage to build a powerful and elaborate network of satellites known as the \"Dutch Boy\", to practically control the weather. However, when unexplained accidents and catastrophic weather malfunctions start to occur, it will be evident that what was invented to protect the Earth, has now become its nemesis, wreaking havoc with random attacks. Can Jake and his estranged brother, Max, stop the string of dysfunctions before a Geostorm--an annihilating worldwide meteorological phenomenon--obliterates mankind?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nIn 2019, following many catastrophic natural disasters, an international coalition commissions a system of climate-controlling satellites called \"Dutch Boy\". After Dutch Boy neutralizes a typhoon in Shanghai, a Senate sub-committee reprimands chief architect Jake Lawson for acting without authorization and replaces him with his brother Max, who works under Secretary of State Leonard Dekkom. Three years later, a UN team stationed in the Registan Desert comes across a frozen village. As suspicions rise about the event being caused by a malfunction of Dutch Boy, the US government decides to send one person to find and fix the system. Later, Makmoud Habib, an Indian engineer working on the International Climate Space Station (ICSS), is shown copying data from the Afghanistan satellite onto an external storage device. Habib stores it in his station locker, but he is unexpectedly ejected into space and killed. After convincing President Andrew Palma to conduct an investigation, Max persuades Jake to go to the ICSS to investigate. Another satellite increases temperatures in Hong Kong, causing gas main explosions that nearly kill Max\'s college friend Cheng Long, the head of Dutch Boy\'s Hong Kong department..', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-14 10:52:17', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::PG\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nColombia::T\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-13\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::13+\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nLuxembourg::12\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMaldives::15+\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::12\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::10-12\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nThailand::G\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUkraine::12\r\nVietnam::C13', 12),

Reckless test pilot Hal Jordan acquires superhuman powers when he is chosen by the Ring, the willpower-fed source of power. Reluctantly at first, he takes on the challenge after the death of Abin Sur, the finest Green Lantern. Putting his self-doubts aside, and spurred on by his sense of duty and love for his beautiful, intellectually equal, colleague, Carol Ferris, he is soon called to defend mankind from Parallax, a powerful, evil being who feeds on fear. Hal Jordan is the universe\'s last chance, as many Green Lanterns have been killed and the Corps is weakened, and he might just be the right Green Lantern for the duty of keeping the world safe from harm.\r\n-\r\nProduction\r\n\r\nThe Guardians of the Universe have divided the universe into 3,600 space sectors, each one protected by one powerful Green Lantern, selected among fearless beings and supplied by a ring fed by the willpower from the planet Oa. When the evil force Parallax that is fed by fear destroys several Green Lanterns, Abin Sur flees in his spacecraft but crashes on Earth. Mortally wounded, his green ring seeks out a successor for him and finds the reckless but efficient test pilot Hal Jordan. Hal Jordan learns about the Green Lanterns and is bestowed with the powers of the ring. Meanwhile, scientist Hector Hammond is summoned to conduct an autopsy of Abin Sur and is possessed by Parallax. Hal Jordan is insecure about his fears and uses his powers for the first time in a party to save the life of people from a Ferris Aircraft helicopter damaged by Hector and later he discloses his identity to his former colleague Carol Ferris, who is the beautiful daughter of Carl Ferris and his love. When Parallax threatens Earth, the Green Lantern Hal Jordan is the last hope to defend his planet from destruction.\r\n-\r\nWarner Bros.

They make their way around the city in order to find their friend before his wedding.\r\n-\r\njrofficial\r\n\r\nAngelenos Doug Billings and Tracy Garner are about to get married. Two days before the wedding, the four men in the wedding party - Doug, Doug\'s two best buddies Phil Wenneck and Stu Price, and Tracy\'s brother Alan Garner - hop into Tracy\'s father\'s beloved Mercedes convertible for a 24-hour stag party to Las Vegas. Phil, a married high school teacher, has the same maturity level as his students when he\'s with his pals. Stu, a dentist, is worried about everything, especially what his controlling girlfriend Melissa thinks. Because she disapproves of traditional male bonding rituals, Stu has to lie to her about the stag, he telling her that they are going on a wine tasting tour in the Napa Valley. Regardless, he intends on eventually marrying her, against the advice and wishes of his friends. And Alan seems to be unaware of what are considered the social graces of the western world. The morning after their arrival in Las Vegas, they awaken in their hotel suite each with the worst hangover. None remembers what happened in the past twelve or so hours. The suite is in shambles. And certain things are in the suite that shouldn\'t be, and certain things that should be in the suite are missing. Probably the most important in the latter category is Doug. As Phil, Stu and Alan try to find Doug using only what little pieces of information they have at hand, they go on a journey of discovery of how certain things got into the suite and what happened to the missing items. However they are on a race for time as if they can\'t find Doug in the next few hours, they are going to have to explain to Tracy why they are not yet back in Los Angeles. And even worse, they may not find Doug at all before the wedding.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nTwo days before his wedding with the wealthy Tracy Garner, Doug Billings travels to his bachelor party in Las Vegas with his best friends, the school teacher Phil Wenneck and the dentist Stu Price, and Tracy\'s unconventional brother Alan Garner. Tracy\'s father lends his convertible Mercedez Benz that is his pride and joy to Doug with many recommendations. The quartet rents the best suite in the Caesar\'s Palace and they go to the roof to celebrate. Alan proposes a toast to Doug and they drink his booze. On the next morning, Phil, Stu and Alan have a hangover and they do not recall what they did last night; the room is upside down; Doug is missing; there is a baby in the wardrobe; a tiger in the bedroom; a chicken in the room; Stu has a missing tooth; and Doug is missing. The trio tries to track down last night to find what happened and sooner they discover that Stu married the stripper Jade (heather Graham) and Alan has spiked their booze with \"Good Morning, Cinderella\" in the beginning of their crazy night.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nThree friends - Doug Billings, Stu Price, and Phil Wenneck head to Las Vegas for a promising epic bachelor party. They take along Alan Garner, Doug\'s fiancÃ©e\'s unhinged brother - along for the ride. What happens in the next 24 hours they will never forget - or remember. Alan, Stu, and Phil all wake up in a luxury villa at Caesar\'s Palace - to find Doug, the guest of honor - missing. They also find a chicken, a tiger, a random baby, a missing tooth, and a parking stub. As they put together the pieces of the night before they soon realize that there is more to this story than once thought. And did Stu get married to a stripper? And where is Doug?\r\n-\r\nhalo1k\r\n\r\nFour life-long friends head off to Las Vegas for a guy\'s weekend, whilst they\'re there one friend (Alan) slips rufflin in the other three\'s (Doug, Stu, and Phil) shot glasses because Alan believes that it is ecstasy, that same night they get so drunk that the next morning three of them wake up (Phil, Stu, and Alan) with no recollection of what happened during the previous night, Doug missing a day before his wedding, a tiger in the bathroom who happens to belong to at once a world heavyweight boxing champion, Mike Tyson, and a baby, whose mother is a prostitute, who Stu married the previous night whilst he was drunk. It also seems that the four rob a viscious Chinese crime-boss\' chips at a casino. From dusk till dawn it\'s the three guy\'s mission to simultaneously rescue their groom to be best friend, return the tiger to Mike Tyson, divorce the prostitute, and pay off the Chinese mobster.\r\n\r\nJust two days before his marriage with Tracy Garner, Doug Billings, in the company of two friends: Phil Wenneck and Stu Price; and Tracy\'s eccentric brother, Alan, head out to party in Vegas. Driving his father\'s Mercedez, they rent a pricey villa at Caesar\'s and head for the rooftop to have a good time. Three of them later wake up with a hangover, unable to re-collect what exactly happened. With the villa in a wreck, they find that they have a baby in the closet; a grown tiger in the bathroom; Stu has a missing tooth and a hooker for a bride; and Doug is missing. Hilarious chaos results as the trio head out to re-trace their steps as well as try to locate Doug and bring him home in one piece before the wedding.\r\n-\r\nrAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)', 'Blu-ray', 1, 0, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-14 10:55:00', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::R18+\r\nAustria::14\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12/9\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::A\r\nIreland::18\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::R18+\r\nMalaysia::(Banned)\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::NC-16\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::18\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nTurkey::15+\r\nUnited Kingdom::18\r\nUnited States::Unrated', 18);

However they kill the witch and escape from the spot. Years later, the orphans have become famous witch hunters. When eleven children go missing in a small village, the Mayor summons Hansel and Gretel to rescue them, and they save the red haired Mina from the local sheriff who wants to burn her, accusing Mina of witchcraft. Soon they discover that the Blood Moon will approach in three days and the powerful dark witch Muriel is responsible for the abduction of children. She intends to use the children together with a secret ingredient in a Sabbath to make the coven of witches protected against the fire. Meanwhile Hansel and Gretel disclose secrets about their parents.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nFifteen years after a horrific experience in a deceptively inviting ginger bread house, an orphan Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) have become famous for ridding the countryside of witches. Despite their stellar success record, the brother and sister face a unique challenge when an extremely powerful witch is identified as the culprit stealing children from a local village with the intent to sacrifice them in an ancient magical ceremony to be held on the night of the Blood Moon. As Hansel and Gretel race against the clock, making several unlikely allies on the way (among them a troll and a witch hunter fanboy), they unexpectedly come across a link to their own pasts and the secret their parents took with them when they disappeared.k.\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-14 10:55:48', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::14\r\nCzech Republic::12\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::18\r\nMaldives::18+\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::R-16\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nThailand::15\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R', 18),

Harry is snatched away from his mundane existence by Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), the groundskeeper for Hogwarts, and quickly thrown into a world completely foreign to both him and the viewer. Famous for an incident that happened at his birth, Harry makes friends easily at his new school. He soon finds, however, that the wizarding world is far more dangerous for him than he would have imagined, and he quickly learns that not all wizards are ones to be trusted.\r\n-\r\nCarly\r\n\r\nHarry Potter is an average bespectacled eleven-year-old boy who has lived with the Dursley family ever since his parents died in a car crash. For some reason, the family has always mistreated him. On his eleventh birthday, a giant man named Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) hands him a letter telling him that he has been accepted as a student at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry learns that his parents were wizards and were killed by the evil wizard Voldemort (Richard Bremmer), a truth that was hidden from him all these years. He embarks for his new life as a student, gathering two good friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) along the way. They soon learn that something very valuable is hidden somewhere inside the school and Voldemort is very anxious to lay his hands on it.\r\n-\r\nSoumitra\r\n\r\nHarry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) thinks he is an ordinary boy celebrating his eleventh birthday, but he is far from right. A giant named Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) appears, and gives Harry the all-important news. He is a wizard. Now his journey in life gets more intense as he travels to Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry to learn the trade of being a wizard. Here, he meets his friends who would be by his side for many years to come. Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) is not a very brave friend and Hermione (Emma Watson) is the smart friend. But not everything is quiet at Hogwarts as Harry suspects someone is planning to steal the Philosopher\'s/Sorcerer\'s Stone.\r\n-\r\nsimon\r\n\r\nOn his eleventh birthday, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) discovers that he is no ordinary boy. Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), a beetle-eyed giant, tells Harry that he is a wizard and has a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. In his first year of magical education, Harry tackles a fully grown mountain troll, learns to play Quidditch, and participates in a thrilling \"live\" game of chess.\r\n\r\nHarry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) thinks that he is an ordinary boy. But on his eleventh birthday, he finally discovered who he really is and he learns that his mum and dad were wizards and witches. Then he realized that he was lucky to survive. Since then, he became a famous person in his new school. In between, a mysterious giant came and gave him a letter telling that he was one of the chosen ones to the school. Therefore he became happy to start a new life and ready to adjust to his new school. As a result, in the school he met two friends, one friend is smart the other one is kind.\r\n\r\nYoung Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) has to lead a hard life: His parents have died in a car crash when he was still a baby, and he is being brought up by his Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths) and Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw). For some reason unbeknownst to the bespectacled ten-year-old, the Dursleys let him live in the small chamber under the stairs, and treat him more like vermin than like a family member. His fat cousin Dudley Harry Melling), the Dursley\'s real son, keeps bothering Harry all the time. On his eleventh birthday, Harry Potter finally receives a mysterious letter from a certain Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, telling him that he is chosen as one of the future students of that supposedly renowned school. Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), the gigantic man who brought the letter, finally introduces Harry into the real circumstances of his life: His parents were a wizard and a witch, they were killed by the evil wizard Voldemort (Richard Bremmer) protecting him. Harry still has a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead from that event. Since he survived the attack as a baby, and also somehow deprived Voldemort from his powers, he has been famous in the wizarding world ever since. The Dursleys, strong disbelievers in that magical crap, never told Harry anything about his true self. So, Harry is strongly surprised, yet absolutely happy to start his training. At Hogwarts, Harry meets his teachers, and becomes friends with Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson). The three of them accidentally find out that the potions master, Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), seems to plot on stealing something that is guarded by a three-headed dog. Since nobody would believe some first years to have found out such important things that even would incriminate a Hogwarts teacher, they take it on themselves to find out what Snape is up to. Their quest for the truth leads across many obstacles, from keeping up the everyday school life, a bewitched Quidditch match (Quidditch is a popular wizard sport), Fluffy, the three-headed monster dog, and quite some tasks one has to overcome to get to the guarded object.\r\n-\r\nJulian Reischl', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-14 10:56:31', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 1, 'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::PG\r\nAustria::6\r\nBrazil::Livre\r\nCanada::G\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-11\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::6\r\nGreece::K-13\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::14\r\nIceland::L\r\nIndia::U\r\nIreland::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nLithuania::N-7\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::A\r\nMongolia::PG\r\nNetherlands::9\r\nNew Zealand::PG\r\nNigeria::G\r\nNorway::11\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPoland::7\r\nPortugal::M/6\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Africa::PG\r\nSouth Korea::All\r\nSpain::A\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::10\r\nThailand::13\r\nUnited Kingdom::PG\r\nUnited States::PG\r\nUkraine::ZA', 0),

People are becoming petrified, and no one knows what is doing it. Harry keeps hearing a voice, a voice which seems to be coming from within the walls. They are told the story of the Chamber of Secrets. It is said that only Salazar Slytherin\'s true descendent will be able to open it. Harry, it turns out, is a Parsel-tongue. This means that he is able to speak with and understand snakes. Everyone thinks that it\'s him that has opened the Chamber of Secrets because that is what Slytherin was famous for.\r\n-\r\nSarah\r\n\r\nHarry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) returns to Hogwarts School of Wizardry for his second year.

When they get there, strange happenings invade the school. \"Mudbloods\" (people of Muggle families) are \"petrified\" by an evil monster lurking in the grounds.

However, he soon learns that a dangerous criminal and Voldemort\'s trusted aide Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban Prison and wants to kill Harry to avenge the Dark Lord. To worsen the conditions for Harry, vile creatures called Dementors are appointed to guard the school gates and inexplicably happen to have the most horrible effect on him.

Unfortunately, there\'s much more danger in the wizarding world than Harry thought. Convicted murderer Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from the wizarding prison Azkaban. Black is known as Lord Voldemort\'s most devoted follower, and he\'s after Harry to avenge Voldemort and finish the job. But not everything is what it seems, and inside of Hogwarts there may just be a traitor.\r\n-\r\nEsamey\r\n\r\n\"He\'s at Hogwarts. He\'s at Hogwarts.\" The infamous Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban Prison and all sources believe he\'s after Harry Potter\'s (Daniel Radcliffe\'s) life. What connection could there be between Harry\'s past and this crazed murderer? Can Harry figure it out before Black gets to him? And why does Mr. Arthur Weasley (Mark Williams) think Harry may want to find Black first? A shocking insight to a night twelve years ago.\r\n-\r\nTrinka\r\n\r\nHarry\'s life is in mortal danger again, this time more than ever. First, a killer named Sirus Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban Prison, and it seems that he broke out just to finish what his master wanted to do thirteen years ago: kill Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe). Also, for Harry\'s protection, Azkaban has sent hundreds of Dementors to guard Hogwarts in an attempt to catch Black. But will they turn out to be a great help or a big mistake?\r\n-\r\nPrince\r\n\r\nApproaching his third year at Hogwarts, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) has had enough of his muggle relatives. He runs away from them (finally) and enters his third term facing trouble from more than one side: for using magic outside the school and from the news that a notorious criminal, Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), has escaped the wizard\'s prison at Azkaban and apparently is headed for Harry. The school calls in supernatural help against Black in the form of Dementors, but unusual things continue to put Harry in peril. He is thrown into a confusing panoply of shifting alliegences and shifting shapes where nobody is who or what they seem. Who is the real criminal? What is the real crime?

They get the tickets to The Quidditch World Cup Final, but after the match is over, people dressed like Lord Voldemort\'s (Ralph Fiennes\') \"Death Eaters\" set a fire to all of the visitors\' tents, coupled with the appearance of Voldemort\'s symbol, the \"Dark Mark\" in the sky, which causes a frenzy across the magical community. That same year, Hogwarts is hosting \"The Triwizard Tournament\", a magical tournament between three well-known schools of magic : Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. The contestants have to be above the age of seventeen, and are chosen by a magical object called \"The Goblet of Fire\". On the night of selection, however, the Goblet spews out four names instead of the usual three, with Harry unwittingly being selected as the Fourth Champion. Since the magic cannot be reversed, Harry is forced to go with it and brave three exceedingly difficult tasks.\r\n-\r\nSoumitra\r\n\r\nHarry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) returns to Hogwarts for his fourth year, where the Triwizard Tournament is soon due to begin. Students must be over seventeen to enter, with the winner receiving eternal glory. Harry can\'t enter it this year, or can he. When his name is read out from the Goblet of Fire, everyone assumes that Harry has cheated. Harry insists that he never placed his name in there, with someone else behind it. But who? Harry must now survive through dragons, sea creatures and a terrifying maze, all before coming face-to-face with a particular dark wizard.\r\n-\r\nFilm_Fan\r\n\r\nThe Tri-Wizard Tournament is open. Four champions are selected to compete in three terrifying tasks in order to win the Tri-Wizard Cup. Meanwhile, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is selected by the Goblet of Fire to compete while struggling to keep up the pace with classes and friends. He must confront fierce dragons, aggressive mermaids, and a dark wizard that hasn\'t been able to make his move for thirteen years.\r\n-\r\nMarcus Plush\r\n\r\nHarry\'s (Daniel Radcliffe\'s) fourth summer and the following year at Hogwarts are marked by the Quidditch World Cup and the Triwizard Tournament, in which student representatives from three different wizarding schools compete in a series of increasingly challenging contests. However, Voldemort\'s (Ralph Fiennes\') Death Eaters are gaining strength and even creating the Dark Mark giving evidence that the Dark Lord is ready to rise again. In the unsuspecting lives of the young wizard and witches at Hogwarts, the competitors are selected by the Goblet of Fire, which this year makes a very surprising announcement: Hogwarts will have two representatives in the tournament, including Harry Potter. Will Harry be able to rise to the challenge for the Triwizard Tournament while keeping up with school or will the challenges along with Voldemort\'s rebirth be too much for the young hero?\r\n-\r\nimann\r\n\r\nThis installment takes us deeper into the characters\' minds and the darkness of the Wizarding World. At the Quidditch World Cup, Voldemort\'s (Ralph Fiennes\') followers gather and wreak havoc. Then, at Hogwarts, a legendary event takes place. The Triwizard Tournament. The Goblet of Fire judges who gets in and who doesn\'t. On the fateful night, three champions are selected. But then the Goblet spits out one other, Harry\'s (Daniel Radcliffe\'s). These two major events point to the return of Lord Voldemort. Dumbledore (Sir Michael Gambon) and the other teachers sense it, but it is inevitable. And Harry is no longer safe at Hogwarts. This installment is the most dramatic, and also the scariest. Let me just say that all does not necessarily end well.\r\n-\r\nJosh Millhouse', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-14 10:58:24', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 1, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::10\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nChina::13\r\nCzech Republic::U\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-11\r\nFrance::Tous publics avec avertissement\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::14\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG-12\r\nLithuania::N-7\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::B\r\nMongolia::PG\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::12\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::7\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13', 12);

Few of students and parents believe him or Dumbledore (Sir Michael Gambon) that Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is really back. The ministry had decided to step in by appointing a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), who proves to be the nastiest person Harry has ever encountered. Harry also can\'t help stealing glances with the beautiful Cho Chang (Katie Leung). To top it off are dreams that Harry can\'t explain, and a mystery behind something for which Voldemort is searching. With these many things, Harry begins one of his toughest years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\r\n-\r\nHPfan\r\n\r\nAfter returning to Hogwarts to begin his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) discovers that much of the wizarding world, including the Ministry of Magic, is in denial about Lord Voldemort\'s (Ralph Fiennes\') return. The Order of the Phoenix, a group sworn against Voldemort, is using its vast array of wizards and witches magical abilities to combat Voldemort. Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy), Minister for Magic, suspects that Dumbledore (Sir Michael Gambon) is using these claims of The Dark Lord\'s return as a means to over-throw Fudge as Minister. In retaliation, a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher is appointed by the Ministry in order to keep an eye on Hogwarts. This new teacher, Professor Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), implies strict new teachings and rules, forcing a group of students, under the tutelage of Harry, to form a club, by the name of \"Dumbledore\'s Army\".\r\n-\r\nLoopy Bug\r\n\r\nAs another year begins for Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), at Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry, so do the never-ending articles stating that he and Dumbledore (Sir Michael Gambon) are insane. As the ministry starts to invent new and malicious lies about Harry\'s account of Voldemort\'s return, Hogwarts begins to change for the worse as the ministry sends in their cure for all of the insanity, Professor Dolores Jane Umbridge (Imelda Staunton). As she begins to inflict her rules and regulations on the students, they begin to find that with her as their teacher, they\'ll never be ready for the outside world. So Harry, along with his friends, decide to take things into their own hands and begin to learn magic the real way. As Harry starts having visions of terrible events happening within the Ministries very walls, he decides to take action, leading himself and his friends into battle, ultimately teaching them what friendship, loyalty, and sacrifice really means.\r\n-\r\nKyle\r\n\r\nAfter a disastrous summer with the Dursleys, including an encounter with the Dementors, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is shunned by friends upon returning to Hogwarts, after the return of Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) and no one believes him. He starts his fifth year while new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Dolores Jane Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) refuses to teach them defensive spells while refuting Harry\'s claims of the Dark Lord\'s return. So Harry sets out, with Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson), to start up \"Dumbledore\'s Army\" to battle evil forces and prepare the fellow young witches and wizards for the extraordinary journey that lies ahead.\r\n-\r\nMichael Anderson\r\n\r\nIt\'s another year at Hogwarts for Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and his friends. The previous year, he witnessed not just the death of Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson), but also the return of the Dark Lord, Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). The Ministry of Magic doesn\'t believe everything Harry says and will do anything to keep everyone calm.

Approached out of the blue by the wizard Gandalf the Grey, Bilbo finds himself joining a company of thirteen dwarves led by the legendary warrior, Thorin Oakenshield. Their journey will take them into the Wild; through treacherous lands swarming with Goblins and Orcs, deadly Wargs and Giant Spiders, Shapeshifters and Sorcerers. Although their goal lies to the East and the wastelands of the Lonely Mountain first they must escape the goblin tunnels, where Bilbo meets the creature that will change his life forever ... Gollum. Here, alone with Gollum, on the shores of an underground lake, the unassuming Bilbo Baggins not only discovers depths of guile and courage that surprise even him, he also gains possession of Gollum\'s \"precious\" ring that holds unexpected and useful qualities ... A simple, gold ring that is tied to the fate of all Middle-earth in ways Bilbo cannot begin to know.\r\n-\r\nProduction\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, the Kingdom of Erebor in the Lonely Mountain was taken from the dwarfs by the evil dragon Smaug. One day, the young Hobbit Bilbo Baggins is unexpectedly visited by the wizard Gandalf the Grey and twelve homeless dwarfs led by their former king Thorin and decided to vanquish Smaug and recover Erebor and their treasure. Bilbo joins the company in an unexpected journey through dangerous lands of the Middle-Earth where they have to fight against Trolls, Orcs and other magic creatures. Bilbo also meets the Gollum and finds his lost magic ring.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nA well mannered Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, embarks upon a journey to take back a kingdom, and a very important jewel ,with twelve dwarves, and a wizard named Gandalf the Grey. Halfway throughout the journey, Bilbo embarks upon a magic golden ring, which he stole, or earned from Gollum.\r\n\r\nWith his days of adventure and excitement nearly forgotten, the now 111-year-old Bilbo Baggins, has finally settled down for a more conventional, comfortable--and above all--safe way of living in his beloved green Shire. Almost sixty years before the formation of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), a knock at Bilbo\'s door from the wise Gandalf the Grey and an assortment of uncontrollable Dwarves led by King Thorin II Oakenshield prepared the ground for an unexpected quest to help them reclaim their homeland, Erebor. As the Lonely Mountain was taken over by the gargantuan gold-loving dragon, Smaug, this unlikely company would face challenge upon challenge that would later seal the fate of the entire Middle-earth.\r\n-\r\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)\r\n\r\nLong before Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) made his arduous journey to Mordor, his brave uncle Bilbo embarked on an adventure for the ages. Bilbo\'s story gets under way when the great wizard Gandalf appears at his front gate with a most unusual offer. Displaced from their massive fortress in the Lonely Mountain by Smaug - a greedy dragon who coveted their gold - a community of noble dwarfs were decimated by a surprise attack by monstrous orcs, whose dreaded leader the Pale Orc slew their king in a gruesome battle. Now, Thorin, the descendant of the king, is determined to reclaim his mountain kingdom for his people. Together with a fearless team of dwarfs, Thorin and Gandalf recruit Bilbo to aid them in their quest since Hobbits have the unique ability to go undetected when they wish to. Before Bilbo, Gandalf, and the dwarfs can reach The Lonely Mountain and defeat Smaug, however, they\'ll have to contend with trolls, goblins, stone giants, Gollum (Andy Serkis), and even the dreaded Pale Orc himself.', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-14 11:01:52', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::PG\r\nChile::TE\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-13\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNigeria::G\r\nNorway::12\r\nPhilippines::G\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::7\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nThailand::G\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUkraine::12', 12);

But Smaug is not easily deceived and flies to Lake-town to destroy the town and the dwellers.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nAs Gandalf the Grey, Bilbo Baggins and Dwarf King Thorin II Oakenshield\'s long and perilous journey to the heart of the Lonely Mountain continues, a relentless pursuit by the vicious orc, Azog, will inevitably lead the brave fellowship into the dark forests of Mirkwood. Without the sage wizard\'s guidance, both hobbit and dwarves must keep on venturing into danger undeterred, concentrating solely on their primary mission to retrieve the stolen Arkenstone from Smaug. But atop a mountain of Erebor\'s pilfered gold, the omnipotent drake is waiting silently, ready to put up a fight for his beloved treasure. Who dares to challenge him?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nThorin and his company are being pursued by Azog and his Orc party following the events of the previous film. They are ushered along by Gandalf to the nearby home of Beorn, a skin-changer who can take the form of the bear. That night, Azog is summoned to Dol Guldur by the Necromancer, who commands him to marshal his forces for war, so Azog delegates the hunt for Thorin to his son Bolg. The following day, Beorn escorts the company to the borders of Mirkwood, where Gandalf discovers Black Speech imprinted on an old ruin. Heeding a promise he made to Galadriel, he warns the company to remain on the path and leaves to investigate the tombs of the NazgÃ»l. Upon entering the forest, the dwarfs lose their way and are ensnared by giant spiders. Bilbo sets about freeing them with the help of his recently acquired invisibility ring. He subsequently drops the ring and first begins to understand its dark influence after he brutally kills a creature to retrieve it..', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-14 11:02:15', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::PG\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-13\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMaldives::15+\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNigeria::G\r\nNorway::12\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::10-12\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nThailand::G\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUkraine::12', 12),

Its a remarkable battle with the Dwarves of Erebor and the Iron Hills, The Elves of the Woodland Realm, The people of Laketown, The eagles lead by Radagast and Beorn and the Orcs of Gundabad and Moria. How will this battle end?\r\n-\r\nlachlan-napier28\r\n\r\nAs Smaug breathes fire and destruction onto Laketown, another sort of dragon-danger threatens Thorin Oakenshield - the gold madness that seized his Grandsire Thror, King Under the Mountain of old. The people of Laketown flee to the ruins of Dale, in the shadow of the Lonely Mountain, only to be greeted by an army of Elves led by Thranduil, marching there too. Asking Thorin for their own fair share of the gold, Men and Elves are answered by Dwarvish defiance. Thorin seems overmatched until an army led by Dwarf-Lord Dain, Thorin\'s kinsman, approaches from the Iron Hills to the northeast. Meantime, Gandalf, imprisoned in the ruins of Dol GuldÃ»r, seems about to be finished off by the Nine Ring Wraiths, led by the deadliest of their lot, Witch King of the ancient, evil realm of Angmar. And what on Middle Earth will happen when an enormous army of Orcs and Wargs suddenly pours out of tunnels under the earth, surrounding and threatening doom to all the other armies gathered at the Lonely Mountain? Orcs and their Fell Beasts, Elves, Dwarves, Men - Five Armies join battle, and the result will determine the fate of the North in the gathering War of the Ring.\r\n\r\nAfter seizing Erebor from Smaug, Smaug burns down Lake-town and the aftermath causes the people of Lake-town to take up refuge in the ruins of Dale which is in the shadow of Erebor. Gandalf is inprisoned by The Necromancer and is eventually rescued and The Necromancer reveals himself as Sauron. Bilbo and Company must protect Erebor from the Elves of Mirkwood, the Gundabad and Moria Orcs, the Men of Lake-town.\r\n\r\nAtop the reclaimed Lonely Mountain, Bilbo Baggins and the fellowship of Dwarves witness the mighty winged drake, Smaug, swooping down upon Laketown in a fit of fiery rage, as refugee denizens and Elves converge on Erebor to claim the realm\'s inestimable treasure. However, as Prince Thorin II Oakenshield rapidly succumbs to the hypnotic allure of the corrupting mounds of gold, friendships shatter over greed, and a war is brewing. And just as all races prepare for battle, dark lord Sauron\'s evil forces led by the Orc chieftain, Azog, emerge from the dark bowels of the earth, flanking the vast battlefield, in Middle-earth\'s greatest conflict that will decide everyone\'s future.\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-14 11:02:35', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-13\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::12\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMaldives::15+\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::12\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::6+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::10-12\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nThailand::G\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUkraine::12', 12),

Unconvinced of the motive, Spooner\'s investigation into Lanning\'s death reveals a trail of secrets and agendas within the USR (United States Robotics) corporation and suspicions of murder. Little does he know that his investigation would lead to uncovering a larger threat to humanity.\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan\r\n\r\nSet in a future Earth (2035 A.D.) where robots are common assistants and workers for their human owners, this is the story of \"robotophobic\" Chicago Police Detective Del Spooner\'s investigation into the murder of Dr. Alfred Lanning, who works at U.S. Robotics, in which a robot, Sonny , appears to be implicated, even though that would mean the robot had violated the Three Laws of Robotics, which is apparently impossible. It seems impossible because.. if robots can break those laws, there\'s nothing to stop them from taking over the world, as humans have grown to become completely dependent upon their robots. Or maybe... they already have? Aiding Spooner in his investigation is a psychologist, Dr. Susan Calvin, who specializes in the psyches of robots.\r\n-\r\nAustin4577@aol.com\r\n\r\nThis is the year 2035. Everybody in the world relies on a huge system of robots, which are programmed specifically to help humans and not harm them in any way. But one person does not think that robots are helpful. Chicago homicide detective Del Spooner. But one day, he received a call from the United States Robotics (USR) about a recent death of renowned robot scientist Dr. Alfred J. Laning. Spooner immediately blamed this incident on robots without justifiable reason or proof. Then, he begins his investigation on Lanning\'s death, only to discover Sonny, a \"unique\" robot. What Spooner does not realize, is that something is about to happen. Something that is beyond even Spooner\'s wildest dreams.\r\n-\r\nJohn Wiggins\r\n\r\nIt\'s the year 2035, and the society now has the help of robots. These robots follow three laws integrated into their system; 1) They cannot harm a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2)They must do whatever they\'re told by a human being as long as such orders don\'t conflict with law one. 3) They have to defend themselves as long as such defense doesn\'t conflict with laws one or two. One day, the writer of the three laws, Alfred Lanning, apparently jumps out of a window at U.S. Robotics. The majority of the Chicago Police Department believe he committed suicide, but Detective Del Spooner, who hates robots, thinks he was murdered, and the number one suspect is a robot who calls himself Sonny. However, if it was Sonny, then it means he would\'ve had to have broken the three laws. With the help of Dr. Susan Calvin, Spooner must now discover the truth before it\'s too late.\r\n-\r\nRidley Lavine\r\n\r\nIt\'s 2035 A.D., where robots are everyday objects and are programmed to live alongside humans. Detective Del Spooner is called out to investigate the apparent suicide of the scientist behind these robots, Dr. Alfred Lanning. Spooner suspects that the death might not be a suicide, but the result of one of the robots. All robots are programmed by three laws, but Spooner starts to wonder if a robot can in fact feel emotions, and possibly murder. But if Spooner\'s suspicions are true, he is going to have a hard time convincing everyone.\r\n-\r\nFilm_Fan', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-14 11:03:23', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::10\r\nCanada::PG\r\nChile::14\r\nCzech Republic::12\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-13\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::12\r\nItaly::T\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nNetherlands::MG6\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::11\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::10\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13', 12),

It is soon learned by the military that a number of enormous objects are on a collision course with Earth. At first thought to be meteors, they are later revealed to be gigantic spacecraft, piloted by a mysterious alien species. After attempts to communicate with the aliens go nowhere, David Levinson, an ex-scientist turned cable technician, discovers that the aliens are going to attack major points around the globe in less than a day. On July 3rd, the aliens all but obliterate New York, Los Angeles and Washington, as well as Paris, London, Houston and Moscow. The survivors set out in convoys towards Area 51, a strange government testing ground where it is rumored the military has a captured alien spacecraft of their own. The survivors devise a plan to fight back against the enslaving aliens, and July 4th becomes the day humanity will fight for its freedom. July 4th is their Independence Day...\r\n-\r\nGustaf Molin\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of July, humans received a strange signal, and this has turned into a global phenomenon. A massive spaceshipwdd headed towards Earth and smaller spaceships began to cover entire cities around the world. Suddenly, the wonder turns into horror as the spaceships destroy the cities with energy desa. Then when the world counterattacked, the alien ships are invincible to military weapons. Then the President ofWda the United tStates decides to head to Area 51, to formulate a plan to defeat the aliens. Now the fate of the world rests on a handful of surviving humans.rd\r\n-\r\nJohn Wiggins\r\n\r\nOn July 2nd, satellite stations experience interference in their systems and the scientists and military believe that it is caused by meteors. Soon they realize that it is originated from the Moon by a huge spacecraft that brings other ones that are positioned over the major cities on Earth including Washington, New York, Los Angeles, Paris, London, Houston and Moscow. World governments do not know the purpose of the alien force. The scientist David Levinson discovers that the aliens are preparing the invasion of Earth, destroying the human species, and he succeeds in reporting to the President of the United States, Thomas J. Whitmore. With an inferior technology, Whitmore and General William Grey decide to give a chance to Levinson\'s plan of downloading a virus in the computer of the alien spacecraft as the last chance of Earthlings to survive.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nFrom the cold and pitch-black depths of the boundless space, a silent and insidious menace enters the solar system; grazes the Moon, and violates the Earth\'s atmosphere: an innumerable spaceship flotilla governed by a hostile and technologically advanced alien life form. As the extraterrestrial adversary\'s indestructible flying saucers wreak havoc on our planet from end to end killing millions, the end of the human race is near--and what is even more certain--we, the powerless and unprepared earthlings, are utterly defenceless. Once, we dreamed of making contact with otherworldly celestial entities. Now that the all-powerful invaders claim our world, the President of the United States and a handful of good men mad enough to stand up for all mankind must make a heroic last stand against the enemy, on a decisive Fourth of July. Will we survive to see another glorious Independence Day?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nThe ultimate encounter when mysterious and powerful aliens launch an all out invasion against the human race. The spectacle begins when massive spaceships appear in Earth\'s skies. But wonder turns to terror as the ships blast destructive beams of fire down on cities all over the planet.

Racing against time, they must find out what Tris\'s family sacrificed their lives to protect, and why the Erudite leaders will do anything to stop them.

Sixteen-year-old Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) lives in a society divided into five factions. Each faction represents a different way of handling things. Erudite are the intelligent. Candor the honest. Abnegation the selfless. Amity the kind. Dauntless the brave. The Erudite have declared war against Abnegation, because they believe that they have important information about the Divergent, who are apparently dangerous for the faction-system. Haunted by her past, Tris must make choices that will change her. While running with her boyfriend Four (Theo James)and her brother Caleb(Ansel Elgort) from Erudite, who want to find her, because of her abnormal brain functioning. She and Four seek shelter in various faction headquarters with other Dauntless who have chosen to fight against Erudite\'s self-proclaimed, smug, superiority. Dauntless are plotting against Erudite, with other allies until Erudite begins to kill people if Tris doesn\'t sacrifice herself. Again, Tris must confront her inner demons and make a choice that may change everything. What she doesn\'t realize is that if she sacrificed herself the world they know may change forever.\r\n-\r\nShailene Woodley\r\n\r\nFive days after the assault on the Abnegation faction by Erudite leader Jeanine (Kate Winslet) and her mind-controlled Dauntless soldiers, Jeanine has declared martial law and that the Divergents and those allied with them are the enemy. Among the Abnegation wreckage, Dauntless leader Eric (Jai Courtney) recovers a five-sided box: each side has a faction symbol. Jeanine presumes it contains data from the city\'s founders and the means to end the Divergence problem. As only a Divergent is capable of opening the box, she orders the capture of all Divergents. 17 year old Tris (Shailene Woodley), Tobias Eaton (Theo James) (also known as Four), Peter (Miles Teller), and Caleb (Ansel Elgort) hide within the Amity compound. Soon after, Eric and his fleet arrive to test all the occupants for Divergence. Peter gives up the group\'s location as Tris, Four, and Caleb escape and board a train headed into Factionless territory. Four reveals to the Factionless that his real name is Tobias Eaton, whom they have been searching for..', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-14 11:06:27', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::14\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::11\r\nPhilippines::G\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nThailand::15\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13', 12);

The police quickly identify and arrest the culprit, and build a slam-dunk case. But instead of confessing, the accused man writes the words, \"Get Jack Reacher.\" Reacher himself sees the news report and turns up in the city. The defense is immensely relieved, but Reacher has come to bury the guy. Shocked at the accused\'s request, Reacher sets out to confirm for himself the absolute certainty of the man\'s guilt, but comes up with more than he bargained for.\r\n-\r\nAnonymous\r\n\r\nWhen 5 seemingly random people are shot by a sniper an investigation leads the police to former Army sniper who has a history of shooting people in the streets when he was in the Army. When he meets his lawyer, Alex Rodin, all he tells her is to find Jack Reacher. She learns that Reacher is a former Army Criminal Investigator. Reacher upon hearing the news arrives. He learns Rodin wants him to help her defend the guy but Reacher doesn\'t want to help him. It seems that Reacher was the one who investigated the shootings he committed when he was in the Army but the Army opted not to prosecute. He told the man that if he did it again, Reacher will come after him. Reacher agrees to look into it if Rodin tries to look at the people he killed. She does and Reacher goes to tell her that the shootings were not the man\'s m.o. Reacher suspects someone is framing him. So he and Rodin try to find out why and who.\r\n-\r\nrcs0411@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nWhen a sniper shoots randomly five victims, Detective Emerson finds evidence to incriminate the former paranoid marine James Barr. It is an easy case for the prosecutor Rodin, but Barr refuses to sign the confession and he calls Jack Reacher. When he is transported to prison in a bus, the other prisoners beat him and Barr goes to the hospital in coma. The pacifist attorney Helen Rodin, who is the daughter of the prosecutor, decides to defend him but Jack Reacher is a former marine investigator that left the army and has become an unknown drifter. Out of the blue, Jack appears in the city and Helen invites him to work for her investigating the case. Soon he finds that the culprit is innocent and there is a conspiracy behind the murders.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nWhen a crazed sniper guns down five seemingly random people on a crowded Pittsburgh riverfront, Det. Emerson (David Oyelowo) quickly amasses enough evidence at the scene to implicate an unstable ex-military sniper named James Barr (Joseph Sikora). Upon being questioned by Emerson and DA Alex Rodin (Richard Jenkins), however, Barr demands to speak with Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise). A former military investigator who fell off the grid following his service, Reacher soon shows up on the scene and begins gathering clues with the aid of talented defense attorney Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike), the daughter of the DA. Meanwhile, when Reacher is assaulted in a local bar, he correctly surmises that someone is determined to impede his investigation. His theory plays out when he becomes the prime suspect in the murder of a young woman shortly thereafter. Now, with the police closing in from one side and a gang of ruthless killers gaining ground on the other, Reacher must use his formidable detective skills in order to catch the gunman and uncover his true motives.\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan\r\n\r\nAfter claiming the lives of five seemingly unrelated targets in broad daylight, the troubled Iraq War veteran and prime suspect, James Barr, summons the reclusive and highly trained nobody, Jack Reacher. As Jack collaborates with Barr\'s defence attorney, Helen Rodin, before long, the pair of investigators will find themselves dragged into a dangerous multi-faceted conspiracy, run by powerful players who are bent on stopping those who dig around. Will Reacher\'s military background be of any use in this intricate case? Above all, what if the authorities don\'t have the right man?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas', 'Blu-ray', 1, 0, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-14 11:07:08', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::16\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::13+\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-15\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nThailand::15\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nVietnam::C16', 12),

Soon the power in the park is shut down by computer systems geek Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight), who wishes to steal embryos from the park to sell to a secret buyer. In the process, many dinosaurs escape their paddocks, including the deadly Tyrannosaurus Rex, who, during a thunderstorm, escapes his paddock and attacks the children, and eats Gennaro. Malcolm is injured and Grant and the children are then lost in the park. Meanwhile, Hammond, Sattler, and the rest of the operations team learn that Nedry (who in the meantime has been killed) has locked up the computer system to cover his tracks. They attempt to get power back in the park in order to escape the island. After shutting down the system, then restoring it, the group realizes that velociraptors are also on the loose, and are now on the hunt for the visitors.\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan\r\n\r\nPaleontologists Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler and mathematician Ian Malcolm are among a select group chosen to tour an island theme park populated by dinosaurs created from prehistoric DNA. While the park\'s mastermind, billionaire John Hammond, assures everyone that the facility is safe, they find out otherwise when various ferocious predators break free and go on the hunt.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nIn high hopes of putting the investors\' minds at ease, John Hammond--the visionary billionaire entrepreneur, and founder of the bio-engineering company, InGen--calls in three experts to witness the wonders of the first-ever dinosaur preserve. There, in the isolated island of Isla Nublar, the visitors\' wide-eyed excitement will soon turn into pure horror, when the palaeontologist, Dr Alan Grant, the palaeobotanist, Dr Ellie Sattler, and the cynical mathematician, Dr Ian Malcolm, come face-to-face with ferocious primaeval reptiles on the loose, after a devastating malfunction. Now, the ultimate apex-predator, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, is on the hunt for fresh meat. Can they escape from the terrors of Jurassic Park?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nOn a remote island, a wealthy entrepreneur secretly creates a theme park featuring living dinosaurs drawn from prehistoric DNA. Before opening the attraction to the public, he invites a top paleontologist, a paleobotanist, a mathematician/theorist, and his two eager grandchildren to experience the park, and help calm anxious investors. However, their park visit is anything but tranquil as the park\'s security system breaks down, the prehistoric creatures break out, and the excitement builds to surprising results.\r\n-\r\nRobert Lynch', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-14 11:11:53', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::Livre\r\nCanada::G\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12/9\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::12RA\r\nIsrael::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nMaldives::12+\r\nMexico::A\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::10\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nUnited Kingdom::PG\r\nUnited States::TV-PG', 12),

Having spent almost a decade protecting his people and fighting injustice, Alejandro\'s wife, Elena, insists that he gives up the black mask, and become a true father to their eight-year-old son, Joaquin. However, when Elena leaves him for the French count, Armand, it becomes evident that the conceited aristocrat is up to no good. Can Zorro, the legendary defender of the innocent, save both his marriage and the country?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nThe legendary Zorro (Antonio Banderas) goes off on another adventure to protect the future of California and its citizens. This time, he fights against evil-doers with the help of his beautiful wife, Elena (Catherine Zeta-Jones), and their precocious young son, Joaquin (Adrian Alonso). Don Alejandro de la Vega is torn between two worlds: his life as Zorro, and his life as a family man. After Alejandro once again breaks his promise to stop wearing the mask, Elena leaves him, and soon begins seeing Armand (Rufus Sewell), a haughty French Count. But a mysterious explosion in the desert leads Zorro to believe that there\'s more to Armand than meets the eye, and our hero is intent on finding out what that is.

But when Laura, a mutant child pursued by scientists, comes to him for help, he must get her to safety.\r\n\r\nIn 2029 the mutant population has shrunken significantly due to genetically modified plants designed to reduce mutant powers and the X-Men have disbanded. Logan, whose power to self-heal is dwindling, has surrendered himself to alcohol and now earns a living as a chauffeur. He takes care of the ailing old Professor X whom he keeps hidden away. One day, a female stranger asks Logan to drive a girl named Laura to the Canadian border. At first he refuses, but the Professor has been waiting for a long time for her to appear. Laura possesses an extraordinary fighting prowess and is in many ways like Wolverine. She is pursued by sinister figures working for a powerful corporation; this is because they made her, with Logan\'s DNA. A decrepit Logan is forced to ask himself if he can or even wants to put his remaining powers to good use. It would appear that in the near-future, the times in which they were able put the world to rights with razor sharp claws and telepathic powers are now over.\r\n\r\nIn the not-so-distant 2029, the entire mutant race is almost obliterated, and Logan, the invincible bestial superhero once known as the Wolverine, finds himself getting old, and his incredible healing ability significantly weakened. As an incognito limo driver, Logan does his best to guard and keep out of sight a weary nonagenarian Professor Xavier; however, things will take an unexpected turn when a cryptic woman asks him to transport the young mutant girl, Laura. A better future lies past the Canadian borders for the unaccompanied teenager, but the government is unwilling to let go of its asset so easily. In the end, can the ageing Logan protect both himself and Laura?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nIn a dystopian 2029, no mutants have been born in 25 years. Logan\'s healing ability has weakened and he has physically aged. The Adamantium coating on his skeleton has begun to leach into his body, poisoning him. Hiding in plain sight, Logan spends his days working as a limo driver in El Paso, Texas. In an abandoned smelting plant in northern Mexico, he and mutant tracker Caliban care for 90-year-old Charles Xavier, Logan\'s mentor and founder of the X-Men. Charles, a telepath, has developed a form of dementia that causes him to have seizures unless controlled with medication. It is alluded that a seizure one year prior, releasing a destructive wave of his telepathic powers, had killed seven mutants, thus leaving the three (Logan, Charles, Caliban) as the last of the X-Men.', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-14 11:14:33', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 1, 'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nAustria::16\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::14\r\nChina::17\r\nColombia::15\r\nCzech Republic::15\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-15\r\nHong Kong::III\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::17+\r\nIreland::15\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::R15+\r\nLithuania::N-16\r\nLuxembourg::16\r\nMalaysia::18\r\nMaldives::18+R\r\nMalta::15\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::R-16\r\nPoland::15\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Africa::18\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nTaiwan::R-15\r\nThailand::15\r\nTurkey::15+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUkraine::16\r\nVietnam::C18', 18),

Fortified in the massive, armored truck the War Rig, they try to outrun the ruthless warlord and his henchmen in a deadly high-speed chase through the Wasteland.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nAfter a narrow escape in the barren deserts of the dystopian Wasteland, the solitary post-apocalyptic survivor, Max Rockatansky, struggles to stay one step ahead from the water-controlling overlord Immortan Joe\'s marauding gangs, the Wild Boys. However, Max will soon cross paths with one of Joe\'s elite lieutenants--the fearless warrior, Imperator Furiosa--who has just fled the Citadel in her heavily armoured War Rig truck, absconding with an irreplaceable quintet of wives. Now, the powerful tyrant and his hordes of delusional zealots are after the unlikely team of Max and Furiosa; however, before the unforgiving Wasteland\'s deadly immensity, who has what it takes to survive?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-14 11:15:58', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::14+\r\nChile::14\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::15\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nLithuania::N-16\r\nMalaysia::(Banned)\r\nMexico::B-15\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::R-16\r\nPortugal::M/14\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::NC16\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nThailand::15\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUkraine::16\r\nVietnam::C16', 12),

They use three gifted humans (called \"Pre-Cogs\") with special powers to see into the future and predict crimes beforehand. John Anderton heads Precrime and believes the system\'s flawlessness steadfastly. However one day the Pre-Cogs predict that Anderton will commit a murder himself in the next 36 hours. Worse, Anderton doesn\'t even know the victim. He decides to get to the mystery\'s core by finding out the \'minority report\' which means the prediction of the female Pre-Cog Agatha that \"might\" tell a different story and prove Anderton innocent.\r\n-\r\nSoumitra\r\n\r\nIn Washington, D.C., in the year 2054, murder has been eliminated. The future is seen and the guilty punished before the crime has ever been committed. From a nexus deep within the Justice Department\'s elite Pre-Crime unit, all the evidence to convict--from imagery alluding to the time, place and other details--is seen by \"Pre-Cogs,\" three psychic beings whose visions of murders have never been wrong. It is the nation\'s most advanced crime force, a perfect system. And no one works harder for Pre-Crime than its top man, Chief John Anderton. Destroyed by a tragic loss, Anderton has thrown all of his passion into a system that could potentially spare thousands of people from the tragedy he lived through. Six years later, the coming vote to take it national has only fueled his conviction that Pre-Crime works. Anderton has no reason to doubt it until he becomes its #1 suspect. As the head of the unit, Anderton is the first to see the images as they flow from the liquid suspension chamber where the Pre-Cogs dream of murder. The faces are unknown to him, but this time, the killer\'s identity is clear when Anderton will murder a total stranger in less than 36 hours. Now with his own unit tracking his every move, led by his rival Danny Witwer, Anderton must go below the radar of the state-of-the-art automated city, where every step you take is monitored. Because people can\'t hide, everybody runs. With no way to defend himself against the charge of Pre-Crime, John must trace the roots of what brought him here, and uncover the truth behind the questions he has spent the past six years working to eliminate: Is it possible for the Pre-Cogs to be wrong?\r\n-\r\nAnthony Pereyra {hypersonic91@yahoo.com}\r\n\r\nIt is the near future, a future where murders have become so common, that a system had to be established. This system is called \"Precrime\", where 3 psychics can predict murders before they happen. Allowing police to stop the murders. This system is in production in Washington D.C. Where police officer John Anderton (who lost his son to a murder 6 years previous) has stopped numerous murders in his career. One day, he found out that he is the next person to commit a murder. Now, he is running away from a system he helped become successful, and trying to find out why he was set up to commit murder.\r\n-\r\nJohn Wiggins\r\n\r\nIn the year 2054, a so-called \"pre-crime division\" is working around Washington, DC. Its purpose is to use the precog(nitive) potential of three genetically altered humans to prevent murders. When the three precogs, who only work together, floating connected in a tank of fluid, have a vision, the names of the victim and the perpetrator as well as video imagery of the crime and the exact time it will happen, are given out to the special cops who then try to prevent the crime from happening. But there is a political dilemma: If someone is arrested before he commits a murder, can the person be accused of the murder, which - because of the arrest - never took place? The project of pre-crime, at the time being in a state of trial run, is going to be voted about in the near future. If people accept it, the crime rate is going to drop drastically, but it never will be known if there might not be too many people imprisoned, some or even all of them innocent. After John Anderton lost his son to a crime a six years ago, he took up drugs, and works the precog division like nobody else. One day, his own name arrives in the \"perpetrator\" chute, and the precogs predict that he will kill a man he never knew in less than 36 hours. John takes off, his trust in the system diminishing rapidly. His own colleagues after him, John follows a very small trace that might hold the key to his innocence, a strange unsolved yet predicted murder and a so-called \"minority report\", a documentation of one of the rare events in which a precog sees something different than the other two.\r\n-\r\nJulian Reischl\r\n\r\nIt is the year 2054 - Washington D.C. - dreams can be recreated through computers, computer monitors and displays are transformed into holograms, and identification is done through eye-scanning. John Anderton lost his son, and to prevent horrible events from occurring to other individuals he joins a unit known as \"Pre-Crime\" - where murderers are arrested before they can commit the murder. How does Pre-Crime work? Through 3 people known as \"precogs\". They are 3 psychics used to see the future and they see murders exactly the way they will occur. Through advanced technology, Pre-Crime officers are able to see what the precogs see, and they analyze the data, identify the perpetrator and victim, and try their best to stop the murder from occurring. The perpetrator is put into a sleep state with a device called a \"halo\".

However, this mystery proves to be difficult to solve, even with the insights of professional illusion exposer Thaddeus Bradley.

One year later, they reappear as The Four Horsemen in a show in Las Vegas sponsored by the millionaire Arthur Tressler, and they heist a bank in Paris from the stage, and distribute the money to the audience. F.B.I. Agent Dylan Rhodes is assigned to the case and Interpol sends agent Alma Dray to be his partner. Dylan and Alma are completely lost in the investigation, and exposer of illusionists Thaddeus Bradley gives hints about illusion. When the Four Horsemen steal the bank account of Arthur Tressler during a show in New Orleans, Dylan and Alma believe that these heists are only a distraction for a huge scheme, but they are never sure about of what is true, and what is illusion.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nFour down-on-their-luck magicians are brought together by an anonymous person who gives them the blueprints to a great illusion. A year later, they call themselves \"The Four Horsemen\", and the finale of their show is that they will rob a bank. The bank they choose to rob is in France, and they do it. The incident is brought to the attention of the F.B.I., so they assign Agent Dylan Rhodes to investigate. Alma Vargas, an Interpol Agent comes to help Rhodes, which he doesn\'t like. They turn to Thaddeus Bradley, a former magician, who exposes magic as simple trickery. Bradley shows them how they did it, but still not enough to give Rhodes grounds to arrest them. So they follow them and they pull another stunt, which makes Rhodes think that they\'re part of a plot to get back at certain people.\r\n-\r\nrcs0411@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nA team of talented illusionists called \"The Four Horsemen\" (Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, and Dave Franco) are investigated by a resolute F.B.I.

Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) is nearing the end of his mission to extract resources essential to the survival of the human race when he witnesses a spacecraft fall from the sky. Upon investigating, Jack discovers the capsule contains a mysterious woman.

Together, they stand as mankind\'s last hope against the mounting apocalypse.\r\n-\r\nDel Torro\r\n\r\nFor years, Earth is repeatedly attacked by giant monsters called Kaiju that emerge from a portal beneath the Pacific Ocean. The only effective defense is the Jaeger program, massive complex robots that require pairs of neural-linked pilots. However, as each Kaiju attack becomes more powerful and frequent, Humanity must change its tactics. To that end, former Jaeger pilot Raleigh Becket is reactivated as part of a desperate plan to destroy the portal. As Raleigh strives to heal his inner scars and help his new partner conquer hers, an intrepid scientist discovers a way to link to the Kaiju\'s mind to learn about them. Unfortunately, that proves a mixed blessing as vital information of both sides is inadvertently shared and the stakes rise for a final battle.\r\n-\r\nKenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com)\r\n\r\nWhen giant lizard like creatures come out of the ocean and attack every city killing millions, all the nations come together and build giant robots called Jaegers. They are piloted by two individuals who are linked up to them mentally. While they are able to defeat the creatures whom they call Kaijus, eventually they adapt and even the Jaegers can\'t stop them. So all the heads of the nations decide to stop the program and to try other tactics. But Pentecost the man in charge of the Jaeger program decide to continue the program. He recruits Raleigh Becket a former Jaeger pilot who left after his co-pilot who\'s also his brother died. He tries to find a compatible co-pilot and when he finds no one, he gives Pentecost\'s assistant, a girl named Mako a chance. And when she proves to be the best, he wants her but Pentecost doesn\'t think she\'s ready. And when they try to hook up with their Jaeger, he sees what she\'s been through, which is what Pentecost was worried about. In the meantime, one of the scientists working on how to defeat the Kaijus thinks he found a way but he needs an actual Kaiju brain so Pentecost sends him to see a man who uses Kaiju remains to make a profit, so that he could get a Kaiju brain.\r\n-\r\nrcs0411@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nWhen Earth is invaded deep beneath the Pacific Ocean from a portal between dimensions in a breach by creatures called Kaijus, the governments join forces and realize that only monsters could destroy the Kaijus. The mankind builds the ultimate machines known as Jaegers, huge robots neurally controlled by two compatible pilots that have their minds interlocked. Years after, Kaijus become more powerful and a scientist discovers that they are part of an alien plan to destroy mankind first and exhaust the planet after. The former pilot Raleigh Becket, who lost his older brother Yancy Becket in a battle against a Kaiju, is summoned by Marshall Stacker Pentecost to fight again together with the rookie Mako Mori in the last hope of mankind.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nThe war between mankind and monsters began when sea monsters or Kaijus start rising from the portal beneath the Pacific Ocean. To fight the Kaijus, humans build giant robots called Jaegers, controlled by two pilots simulteneously. Unfortunately Kaijus began to develop and gets stronger that Jaegers could barely defeat them. On the edge of defeat, Pentecost, the man in charge decided to destroy the portal with the help of Raleigh Becket the Jaeger pilot and a trainee Mako Mori\r\n-\r\nAken Purnomo', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-14 11:24:43', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::14\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::G\r\nCzech Republic::12\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::11\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::7-9\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTurkey::13A\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nVietnam::C13', 12),

To find the key, Will goes aboard the Flying Dutchman, upon which he gets captured. He is reunited by his father on the Flying Dutchman. He finds the key and escapes the ship.

With time running out, Jack must find a way out of his debt or else be doomed to eternal damnation and servitude in the afterlife.

Unfortunately for the notorious pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow, this particular legend is very real. Years ago, Jack made a deal with Davy Jones, who is now expecting him to make good on his promise by handing himself over to Jones\'s servitude. But Jack will not give in without a fight, which is especially bad news for Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, who always seem to get caught up in Jack\'s mishaps.

As his brothers Garsiv and Tus plan battle strategies, a spy sends word that the Holy City of Alamut has been supplying weapons to enemies of Persia. Taking matters into his own hands, Tus orders an attack on the sacred city and upon its fall Dastan encounters the beautiful Princess Tamina. When King Sharaman dies under mysterious circumstances shortly after, and Dastan is accused of his murder, he flees with the princess on a harrowing mission to clear his name. Learning from Tamina the true motives behind Alamut\'s invasion, Dastan must embark on a perilous quest to stop an evil mastermind\'s plot for ultimate power with a mystical weapon that can control the very fabric of time.\r\n-\r\nThe Massie Twins\r\n\r\nIn Persia, in the Royal City of Nasaf, the fair King Sharaman rules the empire with his brother Nizan. Sharaman has two sons, but adopts the orphan Dastan that becomes part of his family. Years later, the Holy City of Alamut ruled by Princess Tamina is under siege of the troops led by Tus, Garsiv and Dastan, after their uncle Nizan had intercepted a spy carrying weapons for Alamut. Dastan invades the city with his men to avoid a massacre and the Persian army conquers the city. Dastan gets a dagger from an enemy and King Sharaman comes to Almut very upset with the invasion of the holy city. Then he arranges the marriage of Dastan with Princess Tamina. When Dastan gives a holy cloak delivered by Tus to his father, the mantle is poisoned and kills Sharaman. Dastan is accused of betrayal but he escapes with Princess Ttamina. Sooner he finds that the dagger is a powerful device to travel and change time and that Tus is not the traitor and he engages with Tamina in a quest for justice.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nAt the height of the Persian Empire\'s power and influence, the King\'s adopted son Prince Dastan leads an attack on the sacred city of Alamut under orders from the Crown Prince, Tus, after it is revealed the city may be the source of arms for their enemies. The battle is quickly won and Dastan takes possession of an interesting dagger, one that Alamut\'s Princess Tamina is keen to recover. Dastan is soon on the run however when his gift to the King poisons him, putting Nizam on the throne. Tamina tells him the importance of the dagger - it can transport the bearer back in time. With his new found weapon, Dastan sets out to change past events and learn the identity of the man who betrayed them and killed his adopted father.\r\n-\r\ngarykmcd\r\n\r\nFrom a street urchin in the bustling streets of ancient Persia, the young orphan, Dastan, finds himself adopted by the righteous King Sharaman for the bravery and his regal heart. Nearly two decades later, an unfounded rumour of arms dealing in the neighbouring sacred city of Alamut will put the young Prince in charge of a mighty siege, as the beautiful Princess Tamina--holder of the mystical device, the Dagger of Time--is taken hostage. However, the unforeseen calamity of King Sharaman\'s untimely death will have Dastan and Tamina on the run, as the real murderer stays out of sight.

Even though he is looking to avoid trouble, trouble has a way of finding him: a group of Christian human rights missionaries, led by Michael Burnett and Sarah Miller, approach Rambo with the desire to rent his boat to travel up the river to Burma. For over fifty years, Burma has been a war zone. The Karen people of the region, who consist of peasants and farmers, have endured brutally oppressive rule from the murderous Burmese military and have been struggling for survival every single day. After some inner contemplation, Rambo accepts the offer and takes Michael, Sarah, and the rest of the missionaries up the river. When the missionaries finally arrive at the Karen village, they find themselves part of a raid by the sadistic Major Pa Tee Tint and a slew of Burmese army men. A portion of the villagers and missionaries are tortured and viciously murdered, while Tint and his men hold the remainder captive. Concerned by their disappearance, the minister in charge of the mission gathers a group of mercenaries and pleas Rambo transport them with his boat, since he knows their last exact location.

The humanitarian mission is going well, until the village is attacked and the missionaries are kidnapped, and Rambo is once again asked to transport - but this time a group of mercenaries, assembled by the missionaries\' minister on a deadly rescue mission. This time he doesn\'t stay behind.\r\n-\r\nDrew Lahat\r\n\r\nIn Thailand, John Rambo is living peacefully capturing snakes and transporting people and cargo in an old boat. When a group of Christian missionaries asks to be transported to the war zone in Burma to help the locals, the reluctant Rambo only accepts when Sarah Miller presents her point of view about their humanitarian mission. Rambo leaves the group in the requested location, but the village where they are working is attacked by the sadistic army of Major Pa Tee Tint, the locals are slaughtered and the missionaries are abducted. Later a member of their church meets Rambo and asks him to transport a group of mercenaries hired to rescue the missionaries.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nIn Thailand, John Rambo is living peacefully capturing snakes and transporting people and cargo in an old boat. But when he joins a group of mercenaries to venture into war-torn Burma, and rescue a group of Christian aid workers who were kidnapped by the ruthless local infantry unit. Rambo refuses, but is convinced by another member, Sarah Miller, to take them up there. When the aid workers are captured by the Burmese army, Rambo decides to venture alone into the war zone to rescue them.\r\n-\r\nAnthony Pereyra {hypersonic91@yahoo.com}\r\n\r\nLiving peacefully somewhere in the green jungles of Thailand, nearly two long decades after the Afghan rescue mission in Rambo III (1988), the unstoppable killing machine, John Rambo, seems to have managed to put the bloodshed of war behind him. However, everything is about to change, when a dauntless team of optimistic missionaries gets captured in war-torn Burma by the vicious militia of the ruthless officer, Major Pa Tee Tint. Now, John has to go back into the mouth of Hell, on a life-or-death operation to save the condemned hostages. Wherever Rambo goes, carnage follows.

As anyone can be anything he desires within the Oasis, the dedicated gamer, Wade Watts--or, better yet, Parzival, after his avatar--is obsessed with finding an elusive Easter Egg hidden meticulously inside the code, to inherit not only an immense fortune but also the game\'s total control.

When his hunting team leaves him for dead, Glass must utilize his survival skills to find a way back home while avoiding natives on their own hunt. Grief-stricken and fueled by vengeance, Glass treks through the wintry terrain to track down John Fitzgerald, the former confidant who betrayed and abandoned him.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nSet in 1820s America, fur trapper and Frontiersman Hugh Glass struggles to survive the harsh winter after an oppressive Ree Indian attack and a mauling from a hostile maternal bear. Abandoned by his crew, Glass attempts to cross the bleak wasteland with only a single notion set in his mind; Revenge.\r\n\r\nIn the untamed and unforgiving wilderness of mid-winter snow-capped Missouri, the experienced nineteenth-century tracker, Hugh Glass, and his son, Hawk, lead a hunting and trapping expedition in the uncharted territory of the fierce Indian tribe, Arikara. As the party of trappers struggle to navigate back to the distant Fort Kiowa, a swift and devastating attack by a formidable grizzly bear leaves a brutally mauled Glass on the brink of death, double-crossed and abandoned by his men. Now, only Hugh\'s rabid desire to live can help him survive the piercing cold and the grave dangers in one of the world\'s most inhospitable environments, giving him the strength to drag his unrecognisable carcass and exact his revenge. However, will the man who has returned from the dead taste the ambrosial fruit of retribution?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-14 11:37:44', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 1, 'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::14\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-15\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIreland::15\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::R15+\r\nLithuania::N-16\r\nMalaysia::18\r\nMexico::B-15\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::R-16\r\nPoland::15\r\nPortugal::M/14\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nTaiwan::R-18\r\nThailand::15\r\nTurkey::15+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUkraine::16', 18);

After Caltech seismologist Dr. Lawrence Hayes\'s team spots worrying quake-predicting data, his colleague Dr. Kim Park follows up at the Hoover Dam, where he dies as at breaks down. As Hayes warns on TV, the persisting parameters indicate the whole San Andreas Fault is going to quake as badly, wrecking metropolises LA and San Francisco. Picking up his ex Emma, Gaines abandons his duty to search for Blake, even after her cellphone breaking down suggests her probably already being buried. Luckily for her, she was saved from the subterranean car parking of duly fleeing Riddicks\'s HQ by applying British architect Ben Taylor, who has a crush on her, encouraged as in all by his dashing kid brother Ollie, so the trio heads for higher ground despite the dim chances of rescue and the likelihood of further collapses, unaware there rescue is on its way.\r\n-\r\nKGF Vissers', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-14 11:38:31', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-13\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::R\r\nIreland::12\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::12\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nThailand::G\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nVietnam::C13', 12),

Meanwhile, Snow\'s childhood friend, William, learns that she is alive and sets off to save her.\r\n-\r\nG.C. Bendixen\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, King Magnus and his Queen have a beautiful daughter, Snow White, who is raised with her best friend William. When the Queen passes away, the King grieves her death but has to fight against a dark invader army. He rescues a beautiful prisoner, Ravenna, and on the next day he marries her. On the wedding night, Ravenna stabs King Magnus in the chest and brings the enemy army led by her brother Finn that destroys the King\'s army. Ravenna imprisons Snow White in the Northern Tower of the castle while William, his father The Duke and a few survivors escape from the castle. Years later, the kingdom is completely depleted and Queen Ravenna, who is an evil witch, keeps her beauty by draining the youth of young ladies. When the Magic Mirror tells that Snow White would be the source of her immortality, she asks Finn to bring the princess to her. However, Snow White escapes and flees to the Dark Forest. Queen Ravenna brings a Huntsman that misses his wife and she promises to bring her back to life provided he catches and brings Snow White to her. But when he captures Snow White, he discovers that the evil Queen lied to him and he becomes the protector of the princess. Meanwhile William learns that Snow White is alive and he heads to join Finn\'s men to meet her. The Huntsman and Snow White meet the eight dwarfs that bring them to the magic Fairytale Land. When they are attacked by Finn and his men, William also finds them and the group heads to the Duke\'s castle with the intention of beginning an uprising against the evil Ravenna.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nEnchanted by the imprisoned Ravenna\'s beguiling beauty, King Magnus decides to marry her after the kind Queen Eleanor\'s untimely demise, only to be seduced to his death on the night of their wedding. As a result, the demonic usurper, Queen Ravenna, banishes her innocent stepdaughter, Snow White, to the castle\'s impenetrable prison, dreaming of becoming an immortal; however--to transform into an everlasting entity, and the fairest of them all--the wicked ruler will need Snow White\'s pure and untainted heart. Before long, the precious prisoner will escape--and as the deceived huntsman sent to capture Snow White joins forces with the realm\'s rightful Princess--her loyal and courageous army of insurgents prepares for the final confrontation. However, is valour alone enough against Ravenna\'s dark sorcery?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas', 'Blu-ray', 1, 0, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-14 11:40:54', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::PG\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::11\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nThailand::13\r\nTurkey::13A\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nVietnam::C16', 12),

For seventeen years, the world\'s survivors are on a train hurtling around the globe creating their own economy and class system. Led by Curtis (Chris Evans), a group of lower-class citizens living in squalor at the back of the train are determined to get to the front of the train and spread the wealth around. Each section of the train holds new surprises for the group who have to battle their way through. A revolution is underway.\r\n-\r\nAnne Campbell\r\n\r\nThe nations release the substance CW-7 with the intention of controlling global warning, but accidentally it results in another Ice Age destroying Earth. The only survivors live in the train Snowpiercer which is driven by a perpetual motion engine created by the millionaire Wilford (Ed Harris) that lives in the engine part. In 2031, after seventeen years, there is a fight of classes inside the train since the oppressed lower class lives in dreadful conditions in the last wagons of the train while the elite lives in the front wagons. The lower class is fed with protein bars only; they are oppressed and punished by Minister Mason (Tilda Swinton) and her brutal guards; and their children are taken every now and then when they reach a certain height. The leaders Gilliam (Sir John Hurt), Curtis Everett (Chris Evans), and Edgar (Jamie Bell) are plotting a scheme to reach the engine and talk to Wilford about their conditions using the addicted security engineer Namgoong Minsoo (Song Kang-ho) and his clairvoyant daughter Yona (Ko Asung) that are imprisoned to open the locked doors. When the son of Tanya (Octavia Spencer), Tim (Marcanthonee Reis), is captured by Mason, they decide to execute their plan. There are many casualties and soon Curtis discovers that they have been manipulated by Wilford to balance the resources in the train, and why the magnate keeps the lower class alive.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nIt\'s 2031, seventeen years after authorities in seventy-nine countries decided collectively to combat global warming with the coolant CW-7. The result was the Earth being immediately sent into a deep freeze, killing all human life except a handful who now live on an \"ark\", a revolutionary train built before 2014 by a train aficionado named Wilford (Ed Harris), the train which at that time was considered useless and self-indulgent. The train is required to be constantly moving to generate energy for life inside, it which circumnavigates the globe on a single continuous track once every year. The train is still controlled in all of its aspects by Wilford, who has created three separate classes housed in different parts of the train: the privileged \"one percent\", who are at the front of the train, the workers who support both ends and occupy the middle of the train, and the \"tail people\", the masses who live at the back of the train like cattle in a windowless cattle car, they being solely fed protein bars, whose ingredients the tail people do not know. The face of Wilford\'s ideology to those in the tail end is Minister Mason (Tilda Swinton), as Wilford never ventures to that end of the train. Some of the policies which Wilford has implemented is taking many of the children from the tail end for an unknown purpose never to be seen by the people in the tail end again, and committing occasional indiscriminate genocide in the tail end, most of the tail people believing as a method of population control, and to demonstrate his dictatorial power in an effort to have a complacent populace amongst the masses. There have been many attempts of revolution by the tail people in the past, all quashed by Wilford. Curtis (Chris Evans), one of the tail people, wants to attempt another revolution, he believing all past attempts having failed because they have focused on Wilford, as opposed to what he feels needs to occur for power: take control of the engine at the front. Supporting Curtis in this fight are, amongst others: Gilliam (Sir John Hurt), the wise old man; Edgar (Jamie Bell), who Curtis took under his wing when he became orphaned in the early years; and Tanya (Octavia Spencer) and Andrew (Ewen Bremner), who want to find their children taken away. Along the way, they have to co-opt Namgoong Minsoo (Song Kang-ho), an addict of a synthetic hallucinogen called Kronole, he who designed the security system, namely the locking mechanism of the gates between all the train cars. As Curtis and his team try to work their way from car to car from the tail to the front, their priorities are influenced by what they see, what they learn, and by revelations including secrets from their individual pasts.\r\n-\r\nHuggo', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-14 11:41:26', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nMalaysia::18\r\nMexico::B-15\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::R-16\r\nSingapore::NC16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R', 18),

In the 1800s, a boy becomes a man when he ventures through the breach in pursuit of a fallen star, to prove his love for the village beauty. The star is no lump of rock, it\'s a maiden, Yvaine. Tristan, the youth, is not the only one looking for her: three witches, led by Lamia, want her heart to make them young; and, the sons of the dead king of Stormhold want her because she holds a ruby that will give one of them title to the throne. Assisting Tristan are his mother, the victim of a spell, and a cross-dressing pirate of the skies. Will Tristan win his true love?\r\n-\r\n\r\nIn the 1800s, the clumsy teenager Tristan Thorn crosses the wall in the border of his town to the magic realm of Stormhold to bring a fallen star to his beloved Victoria, a spoiled girl that does not love him, but has promised to marry him if he accomplishes his promise. In the fantasy kingdom, he meets the star Yvaine and imprisons her with a magic rope, promising to release her after meeting Victoria. Yvaine was hit by the magic ruby of the evil King of Stormhold that has promised his throne to the son that could find the stone. Meanwhile, three evil witches led by Lamia seek Yvaine to eat her heart and make them young again, and the two sons of the dead King also search for Yvaine because she wears the necklace with the powerful ruby.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nThe tiny English village of Wall has a secret. Through a gap in the town\'s old stone wall lies the kingdom of Stormhold, a magical realm of spells, unicorns and witches. One day a boy named Tristan Thorn makes a bet with Victoria, the girl of his dreams, that he can bring her back a falling star that lands beyond the wall. So he journeys through the gap into the wall and into the other world, determined to bring back the fallen star in seven days and win Victoria\'s hand in marriage. To his surprise, the star in question is not a lump of rock, but a plucky celestial Princess named Yvaine, who is not at all pleased to be knocked out of the sky and subsequently kidnapped. And a fallen star, it seems, is quite a commodity in Stormhold. Soon Tristan and Yvaine are running from flying pirates, warring Princes, and three wicked witches who want to cut Yvaine\'s heart out of her chest and eat it in order to restore their eternal youth.

Johnny Rico joins the military after graduation to become a citizen and for the love of his high school sweetheart. In the war against the bug aliens of Klendathu, the military is a very dangerous place to be. Johnny works his way through several battles and with the help of his friends and comrades, helps turn the tide of the war, and save the human race.\r\n-\r\n\r\nSet on the future earth, Johnny rico is a young student dating a girl named Carmen. When Carmen decides to join the military in order to become a class citizen (citizenship is only achieved through serving your country), Johnny follows and joins as well. He soon realizes that he joined for the wrong reasons but just as he is about to quit, an asteroid that originated from the orbit of planet \"klendathu\" hits Buenos Aires (his home town) and kills his family. Johnny and his fellow troopers set out to destroy the planet\'s inhabitants: a type of deadly and very large scaled space bugs. Through a seemingly ordinary action flick, director paul verhoeven creates a subtle anti-war theme, that shows us a fascist and military world far more frightening than WW2\'s Germany, Italy or Russia, the kind of world that is actually functioning.\r\n-\r\nguyshemi\r\n\r\nEarth is united under militaristic organization called \"Federation\". Even in 4school students like Johnny Rico are thought about importance of serving to the Federation.

In the background Federation is in war with highly intelligent insectoid population that has colonized many worlds and are now trying to exterminate humans. Carmen decides to go to a school for a pilot in hope of commanding her own space ship one day and Johnny follows her not wanting to separate, but they eventually get separated in the line of duty when Johnny ends up in the Infantry and Carmen in the Fleet. When tragedy obliterates their home city of Buenos Aires, Johnny gets determined more than ever to put an end to the insectoid aggressor. Driven by hatred of the insectoids, and jealousy for Carmen\'s new boyfriend, Johnny strives to become one of the best soldiers Federation has ever seen...

Kirk\'s birth, his father dies on his damaged starship in a last stand against a Romulan mining vessel looking for Ambassador Spock, who in this time, has grown on Vulcan disdained by his neighbors for his half-human heritage. 25 years later, James T. Kirk has grown into a young rebellious troublemaker. Challenged by Captain Christopher Pike to realize his potential in Starfleet, he comes to annoy academy instructors like Commander Spock. Suddenly, there is an emergency on Vulcan and the newly-commissioned USS Enterprise is crewed with promising cadets like Nyota Uhura, Hikaru Sulu, Pavel Chekov and even Kirk himself, thanks to Leonard McCoy\'s medical trickery. Together, this crew will have an adventure in the final frontier where the old legend is altered forever as a new version of the legend begins.\r\n-\r\nParamount Pictures\r\n\r\nWhen a Romulan mining vessel attacks the USS Kelvin, Lt. George Kirk substitutes his captain, who goes to meet the Romulan captain on his vessel to negotiate a ceasefire.

Aboard the USS Enterprise, the most sophisticated starship ever constructed, a novice crew embarks on its maiden voyage. Their path takes them on a collision course with Nero, the Romulan captain from the future whose mission of vengeance threatens the Federation. Once humanity would survive, rebellious young officer James T. Kirk and coolly logical Vulcan officer Spock must move beyond their rivalry and find a way to stop Nero before he destroys Earth.\r\n-\r\nBlazer346', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-14 11:45:58', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::10\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::G\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-13\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nIceland::10\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::11\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::G\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::10\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::10\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13', 0),

Senior US Intelligence officer Amanda Waller comes up with a daring plan - use extreme criminals with special abilities to fight crime, in exchange for them receiving reduced sentences. The band of crime-fighting criminals is officially known as Task Force X, but due to the nature of their mission a more appropriate name would be Suicide Squad.\r\n-\r\ngrantss\r\n\r\nUnder the threat of humanity\'s total annihilation and for fear that the next superhero saviour turns terrorist, the pitiless Government Agent from the Intelligence Division, Amanda Waller, decides to assemble an Elite force of meta-humans, the secret Task Force X. For this reason, Waller handpicks the worst of the worst from the country\'s maximum security prisons; a proper circus of psychotic antisocial super villains kept on a short leash to do the Government\'s dirty work. Of course, none of them knows that, in reality, they form an expendable suicide squad thrown into the fire, and if anything goes wrong, the Federals will deny everything. However, Waller\'s plan to protect the country is flawed, and when a member of the team, the uncontrollable and omnipotent shape-shifting sorceress known as the \"Enchantress\" goes rogue with the intention to build a devastating machine, the squad and everyone around will need to prepare for WWIII. Is this band of anti-heroes humanity\'s only hope?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-14 11:46:46', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::PG\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nCzech Republic::12\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-15\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::17+\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMaldives::18+\r\nMalta::15\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::R13\r\nNorway::12\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nPuerto Rico::PG-13\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSlovakia::12\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nThailand::G\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUkraine::16\r\nVietnam::C16', 12),

The Autobots managed to smuggle the Allspark off the planet, but Megatron blasts off in search of it. He eventually tracks it to the planet of Earth (circa 1850), but his reckless desire for power sends him right into the Arctic Ocean, and the sheer cold forces him into a paralyzed state. His body is later found by Captain Archibald Witwicky, but before going into a comatose state Megatron uses the last of his energy to engrave into the Captain\'s glasses a map showing the location of the Allspark, and to send a transmission to Cybertron. Megatron is then carried away aboard the Captain\'s ship. A century later, Captain Witwicky\'s grandson Sam Witwicky (nicknamed Spike by his friends) buys his first car. To his shock, he discovers it to be Bumblebee, an Autobot in disguise who is to protect Spike, who possesses the Captain\'s glasses and the map engraved on them. But Bumblebee is not the only Transformer to have arrived on Earth - in the desert of Qatar, the Decepticons Blackout and Scorponok attack a U.S. military base, causing the Pentagon to send their special Sector Seven agents to capture all \"specimens of this alien race.\" Spike and his girlfriend Mikaela find themselves in the midst of a grand battle between the Autobots and the Decepticons, stretching from Hoover Dam all the way to Los Angeles.

Warriors from Asgard stopped them, but their leader Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) escaped to wait for another opportunity. The warriors find the Aether, and since it cannot be destroyed, they try to hide it. In the present day, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) awaits the return of Thor (Chris Hemsworth), although it has been two years since they last saw once another. In the meantime, Thor has been trying to bring peace to the nine realms. Jane discovers an anomaly similar to the one that brought Thor to Earth. She goes to investigate, finds a wormhole, and is sucked into it. Back on Asgard, Thor wishes to return to Earth, but his father, Odin (Sir Anthony Hopkins), refuses to let him. Thor learns from Heimdall (Idris Elba), who can see into all of the realms, that Jane disappeared. Thor then returns to Earth just as Jane reappears. However, when some Policemen try to arrest her, an unknown energy repulses them. Thor then brings Jane to Asgard to find out what happened to her. When the energy is released again, they discover that when Jane disappeared, she crossed paths with the Aether and it entered her. Malekith, upon sensing that the time to strike is now, seeks out the Aether. He attacks Asgard and Thor\'s mother Frigga (Rene Russo) is killed protecting Jane. Odin wants to keep Jane on Asgard so that Malekith will come. Thor disagrees with his plan, so with his cohorts, he decides to take Jane away. He enlists the aid of his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Unfortunately, Loki\'s motivations remain unknown.\r\n-\r\nrcs0411@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nThere are nine realms of Asgard, and once every five thousand years, they align. Earth happens to be one of these realms. These realms create portals between the worlds during the alignment which is called \"Convergence\". On Earth, in London, England, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) believes she and her crew have discovered one such portal. Foster, while investigating the phenomenon, is transported to another realm and comes in contact with a substance called the Aether. Upon coming into contact with the substance, it draws Thor (Chris Hemsworth) from Asgard back to Earth. Thor takes Jane to Asgard to be cured from the Aether. Unfortunately, in doing so, it draws more than just Jane to that world. Another being called Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) wants to use the Aether to destroy Asgard. Devising a plan with his brother, the war criminal Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Thor heads to \"The Dark World\" to destroy the Aether and save Asgard.

Thor frees himself, defeats Surtur, and takes his crown, believing he has prevented RagnarÃ¶k. Thor returns to Asgard to find Heimdall (Idris Elba) gone and his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) posing as Odin. After exposing Loki, Thor forces him to help find their father, and with directions from Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) on Earth, they locate Odin in Norway. Odin explains that he is dying, and RagnarÃ¶k is imminent despite Thor\'s efforts to prevent it.

She then resurrects the ancient dead who once fought with her, including her giant wolf Fenris, and appoints the Asgardian Skurge (Karl Urban) as her executioner.

It is based on the book series of the same name by Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski. The Witcher follows the story of Geralt of Rivia, a solitary monster hunter, who struggles to find his place in a world where people often prove more wicked than monsters and beasts. But when destiny hurtles him toward a powerful sorceress, and a young princess with a special gift, the three must learn to navigate independently the increasingly volatile Continent.\r\n-\r\naaltaiawy\r\n\r\nGeralt of Rivia, a brooding professional monster hunter for hire also known as witcher, struggles to keep his humanity in a medieval dark fantasy world ruled by corrupt kings, queens and mages, where poverty, violence and intolerance are rampant, normal humans are sometimes worse than actual monsters and most jobs that pay well involve the darkest of human emotions and desires. Yennefer of Vengerberg is an ambitious mage who came from nothing and wants everything. Princess Cirilla or Ciri is a young girl who may or may not possess some great mysterious power within her. Their destinies, seemingly quite different, slowly intertwine in a rather cosmic fashion. Their companions include Jaskier the bard, Geralt\'s endearingly annoying friend and hype man vowed to spread the word of his heroics throughout the continent even if he has to embellish them a little for a few coins more, Tissaia de Vries, Yennefer\'s secretive mentor who believes in tough love, and Triss Merigold, a good-natured druidic mage and trustworthy friend. The Nilfgaardian Empire\'s sudden brutal invasion of the kingdom of Cintra ruled by Cirilla\'s protective grandmother, warrior queen Calanthe, puts their lives in great danger.\r\n\r\nGeralt of Rivia is a witcher, a mutant with special powers who kills monsters for money. The land is in a state of turmoil, due to the empire of Nilfgaard seeking to enlarge its territory.

However, the Ultron decides that is necessary to annihilate mankind in order to save the planet, attacks the Avengers and flees to Sokovia with the scepter. He builds an armature for self-protection and robots for his army and teams up with the twins. The Avengers go to Clinton Barton\'s house to recover, but out of the blue, Nick Fury arrives and convinces them to fight against Ultron. Will they succeed?\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nAfter a successful raid on a HYDRA base, Tony Stark and Bruce Banner create an Artificial Intelligence called Ultron, a peacekeeping protocol designed to help the Avengers protect the world from their enemies. But things go wrong when Ultron sees the human race as a threat and sets out to destroy it along with the Avengers. Now the Avengers, Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, the Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye, must reassemble to stop Ultron from causing mass destruction. Aside from this, the Avengers also must take on the powerful twins Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch as well as the new entity called Vision. Also, the Avengers find that things may never be the same again after discovering a power beyond their comprehension.\r\n\r\nThis sequel to the smash-hit comic-book epic The Avengers finds the iconic superhero team dealing with a threat of their own making: a sentient robot called Ultron (voice of James Spader), who was originally designed as part of a peacekeeping program. Since the events of the last film, Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) have been working to take down various cells of a secret society of villains known as HYDRA. Their zeal to make the world a better, safer place inspires Tony Stark, genius billionaire and alter ego of Iron Man, to create Ultron in order to respond to additional threats that the Avengers aren\'t able to handle. Ultron, unfortunately, takes this directive way too seriously -- he believes that world peace can only be achieved by exterminating humanity, and he\'ll stop at nothing to accomplish this goal. The battle between the Avengers and Ultron is further complicated by the appearance of super-powered siblings Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), who ally themselves with the homicidal android.', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-15 13:40:30', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nCzech Republic::12\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::13+\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMaldives::15+\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::12\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSlovakia::12\r\nSouth Africa::10-12\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::7\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nThailand::G\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nVietnam::P', 12),

She is an employee of the state-run British Television Network, but soon, she becomes the number one enemy of the state together with an enigmatic and larger-than-life freedom fighter known only by the letter \"V\". V informs Evey that she must hide in his underground lair for at least one year, and while she is reluctant to the idea at first, a bond soon forms between the two individuals. In the meanwhile, the mysterious past of V is gradually revealed to the police inspector tasked with capturing him, Eric Finch, and it is not long until he starts questioning everything his government stands for.\r\n-\r\ngoddangwatir\r\n\r\nTells the story of Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) and her unlikely but instrumental part in bringing down the fascist government that has taken control of a futuristic Great Britain. Saved from a life-and-death situation by a man in a Guy Fawkes mask who calls himself \"V\" (Hugo Weaving), she learns a general summary of V\'s past and, after a time, decides to help him bring down those who committed the atrocities that led to Britain being in the shape that it is in.\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan\r\n\r\nSet against the futuristic landscape of totalitarian Britain, this movie tells the story of a mild-mannered young woman named Evey (Natalie Portman), who is rescued from a life situation by a masked guy known only as \"V\" (Hugo Weaving). Incomparably charismatic skilled in the art of combat. V detonates two London landmarks and takes over the government, urging his fellow citizens to rise up. As Evey uncovers the truth about V\'s mysterious background, she also discovers the truth about herself and emerges as his unlikely ally in the culmination of his plot to bring freedom and justice back to a society fraught with cruelty and corruption.\r\n-\r\nAlex W\r\n\r\nIn the not too distant future, Britain is filled with torture cells, unfair punishments, prejudice against minorities. However, in the midst of all this chaos, one man known only by the name V (Hugo Weaving) dares to stand up to the government and is labeled as a terrorist. One night V rescues a mild young woman called Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), and an unlikely bond between the two emerges which results with Evey becoming Vs ally. But though V may be charismatic and have a passion for justice he also is bitter and has his own personal hatred of the government for something they did to him long ago. As November the 5th, the day V says he and those who will follow him will stand up to the government once and for all approaches, Detective Finch (Stephen Rea) becomes more and more determined to uncover the truth about V, however his search leads him to ask to question whether or not he is on the right side.\r\n-\r\nx_babyangel\r\n\r\nIn this obscure and Gothic tale, one attractive girl, Evey (Natalie Portman), gets involved accidentally in a terrorist attack, perpetrated by a masked and megalomaniac character, V (Hugo Weaving). V is following the same steps of Guy Fawkes, a sort of terrorist of the XVII century, who wanted to blow up the English Parlament in London. However, in present time, the Orwellian London lives under the fascist government of Chancellor Adam (Sir John Hurt), and V will fight against his regime, using the power of powder, blowing up important buildings. Evey will be chased by the Secret Police, thinking that she\'s the accomplice of V, who will accomplish Fawkes\' mission of destroying the Parlament on the 5th of November, in this mixture of The Phantom of the Opera, George Orwell\'s 1984, and Batman.\r\n-\r\nAlejandro Frias', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-19 13:09:12', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nAustria::16\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nColombia::12\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-15\r\nFrance::Tous publics avec avertissement\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-17\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIreland::15A\r\nIsrael::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG-12\r\nMalaysia::18SG\r\nMexico::B-15\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R13\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R', 18),

When Julia accidentally dies during a performance, Robert blames Alfred for her death, and they become enemies. Both become famous and rival magicians, sabotaging the performance of the other on the stage. When Alfred performs a successful trick, Robert becomes obsessed trying to disclose the secret of his competitor with tragic consequences.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nSet in London in the 1800s, two rival magicians read each others diary containing the secrets of their magic tricks and personal life. As we go back in time when the diaries were written, both magicians become obsessed with their rival\'s best trick. The tricks, as shown to the audience, look the same, but neither magician can figure out how his opponent does it.\r\n-\r\ngary\r\n\r\nTwo magicians, who used to be partners, battle over years in order to create a flawless method for the ultimate disappearing trick, \"the Transported Man\", turns into an informal war between them, and soon, they will do anything to be able to preform the trick sooner and better than the other; which as time passes makes their friends and loved ones get away from them, and little-by-little destroys their lives until they eventually succeed to preform the trick, each by a very different way.\r\n-\r\nJ. S. Golden\r\n\r\nIn nineteenth century London, illusionist Alfred Borden is on trial for the murder of fellow illusionist, Robert Angier. Borden\'s indictment is largely possible because of the eyewitness account of John Cutter, who saw Borden backstage in the area where Angier was killed. At the end of one of his shows, Angier fell through a trap door in the stage floor into a clear water-filled tank below, that tank which was a prop for one of Angier\'s tricks performed earlier in the show. Angier ended up drowning, as the tank was locked after he fell into it. Borden, Angier, and Cutter have a shared largely turbulent history, which also provides motive. Early in their magic careers, both Borden and Angier worked under \"Milton the Magician\", while Angier\'s wife Julia worked as his on-stage assistant, and Cutter as his ingÃ©nieur, staging the tricks and providing the apparatus required, work that he still does for others. Based on a specific incident during this stage of their relationship led to both Borden and Angier striking out, creating their own shows, and them having a feud, which was not only in the professional realm, but a personal one, where each man wanted to ruin the other. While Borden is arguably more accomplished in the technical aspects of the illusions, Angier is the more accomplished showman. In the professional realm, they tried to outdo each other, especially in the illusions considered either the most dangerous and/or mysterious, those two being catching-the-bullet trick, and more so, the transported man trick. In the process of their feud, they seemingly were not averse to any means, even with collateral damage of others. The question is if those means extend to murder, especially of the other.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nIllusionists Angier & Borden were once stage partners, but when a trick goes tragically wrong the pair form an intense rivalry which endangers the lives of their loved ones. The Prestige is an intricate tale of obsession, jealousy and deception.\r\n-\r\nBecksyKane\r\n\r\nA mysterious story of two magicians, whose intense rivalry leads them on a life-long battle for supremacy, full of obsession, deceit, and jealousy, with dangerous and deadly consequences. From the time that they first met as young magicians on the rise, Robert Angier and Alfred Borden were competitors. However, their friendly competition evolves into a bitter rivalry making them fierce enemies-for-life, and consequently jeopardizing the lives of everyone around them.

Marion senses an opportunity when one of Lowery\'s wealthy clients pays his account with forty thousand dollars cash, Marion is tasked with taking the money to the bank. Being a Friday afternoon, Marion believes she can slip out of town immediately undetected with the money to join Sam in Fairvale, California where he lives, before Lowery would even suspect that she has absconded with the money the earliest by Monday. Despite several close calls, Marion is able to make it to fifteen miles short of Fairvale at the Bates Motel, where she stops on the rainy Saturday night. The isolated motel has had little business ever since the state highway was moved. The motel is run by friendly, but lonely Norman Bates, who lives with with his invalid mother in the big, old house on the hill overlooking the motel.

That evening, Marion has a change of heart and contemplates returning to Phoenix to return the money. But she never makes it either to Phoenix or Fairvale. As such, several people come looking for her, including Sam, who is suspected of being in cahoots with Marion in stealing the money, Marion\'s worried sister Lila Crane, who is able to convince Lowery not to press charges if Marion returns the money, and a private investigator named Arbogast who was hired by Lowery.

The two form an odd relationship as the student wants to achieve greatness, and the professor pushes him.\r\n-\r\nandrewhodkinson\r\n\r\nNineteen year old Andrew Niemann wants to be the greatest jazz drummer in the world, in a league with Buddy Rich. This goal is despite not coming from a pedigree of greatest, musical or otherwise, with Jim, his high school teacher father, being a failed writer. Andrew is starting his first year at Shaffer Conservatory of Music, the best music school in the United States. At Shaffer, being the best means being accepted to study under Terence Fletcher and being asked to play in his studio band, which represents the school at jazz competitions. Based on their less than positive first meeting, Andrew is surprised that Fletcher asks him to join the band, albeit in the alternate drummer position which he is more than happy to do initially. Andrew quickly learns that Fletcher operates on fear and intimidation, never settling for what he considers less than the best each and every time. Being the best in Fletcher\'s mind does not only entail playing well, but knowing that you\'re playing well and if not what you\'re doing wrong. His modus operandi creates an atmosphere of fear and of every man or woman for him/herself within the band. Regardless, Andrew works hard to be the best. He has to figure out his life priorities and what he is willing to sacrifice to be the best. The other question becomes how much emotional abuse he will endure by Fletcher to reach that greatness, which he may believe he can only achieve with the avenues opened up by Fletcher.\r\n-\r\nBuddy Rich\r\n\r\nAndrew Neimann is an ambitious young jazz drummer, single-minded in his pursuit to rise to the top of his elite east coast music conservatory. Plagued by the failed writing career of his father, Andrew hungers day and night to become one of the greats. Terence Fletcher, an instructor equally known for his teaching talents as for his terrifying methods, leads the top jazz ensemble in the school. Fletcher discovers Andrew and transfers the aspiring drummer into his band, forever changing the young man\'s life. Andrew\'s passion to achieve perfection quickly spirals into obsession, as his ruthless teacher continues to push him to the brink of both his ability-and his sanity.\r\n-\r\nSpencer Higham\r\n\r\nTerence Fletcher a professor at Shaffer Conservatory of Music always discourages his students so that they don\'t get discouraged later on. Andrew Neimann an ambitious and highly talented jazz drummer overcomes depression and all the emotional abuses put by Fletcher. His professor makes him realise that \"No two words in english language are harmful than \'Good Job\'\". Finally Neimann understands that Fletcher expects much beyond his student\'s talent and all these hurdles are consequences of his expectations.\r\n-\r\nSiddhartha Devineni\r\n\r\nAndrew is a drummer and a first year student at the Schaffer Conservatory. He is selected by the school\'s senior instructor, Mr. Fletcher, to play on his studio band. Fletcher is - to say the least - a difficult and demanding task master who accepts and expects nothing less that perfection from his students. His methods of exacting the best from his students include belittling them, throwing objects at them and creating a level of tension so high that average individuals would likely crumble under the pressure. It leads Andrew to eventually quit but a surprise encounter with Fletcher gives him a chance to show just what he can accomplish - or to fail miserably.\r\n-\r\ngarykmcd\r\n\r\nAndrew Neimann, a nineteen year old drummer is heading to Shaffer Conservatory with a desire of becoming one of the best musicans there is of the 21st century. Though his instructor and teacher Terrence Fletcher does not seem to be very pleased with his progress and effort. Being great has become far more difficult than Andrew has ever imagined. Blood, sweat, and tears are not enough.\r\n-\r\nhenden_jr\r\n\r\nWith dreams of becoming one of the best jazz drummers in the world, Andrew Neiman enrols himself into a prestigious music conservatory.

He\'s been pushing for an assignment on the island for personal reasons, but before long he thinks he\'s been brought there as part of a twisted plot by hospital doctors whose radical treatments range from unethical to illegal to downright sinister. Teddy\'s shrewd investigating skills soon provide a promising lead, but the hospital refuses him access to records he suspects would break the case wide open. As a hurricane cuts off communication with the mainland, more dangerous criminals \"escape\" in the confusion, and the puzzling, improbable clues multiply, Teddy begins to doubt everything - his memory, his partner, even his own sanity.\r\n-\r\nalfiehitchie\r\n\r\nFederal Marshall Teddy Daniels and his new partner Chuck Aule travel to a government-run institution for the criminally insane on Shutter Island, near Boston, when there is a report that a prisoner has gone missing.

He is still traumatized from what he saw when his army unit liberated one of the Nazi concentration camps at the end of World War II, and still haunted by his wife\'s more-recent death in a fire. The head of the hospital, Dr. John Cawley, treats him decently, but others give the agents a cooler reception. Daniels particularly wants to find out what goes on in the ward that\'s reserved for the most serious offenders. As he begins to peel away the layers of deceit, it becomes obvious that not all is as it seems.\r\n-\r\ngarykmcd\r\n\r\nAssigned the thorny task of investigating the incomprehensible disappearance of a deranged child-murderess, troubled U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels and his new partner, Chuck Aule, travel to Ashecliffe Hospital: Shutter Island\'s impregnable asylum for the criminally insane. Soon, within the dark purgatory\'s thick stone walls, indescribable nuances of medical malpractice suggest that the institution\'s cryptic senior psychiatrists must be hiding something. Then, a raging tempest traps patients and investigators alike in the dark off-shore prison, triggering Teddy\'s crippling migraines and gruesome flashbacks of a haunting past. Is the already perplexed detective losing his grip on reality?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nIn 1954, Federal Marshal Teddy Daniels and his new partner Chuck Aule travel from Seattle to Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a patient there, Rachel Solando. She had been sectioned at the institution for dangerous criminals at Ashcliffe Hospital because she drowned her three kids. Teddy is a veteran WWII soldier, traumatized by the war experience in the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp and the loss of his beloved wife in a criminal fire. Teddy is unable to access the records of employees and patients and feels that the management by the Federal facility are obstructing his investigations. Severe migraines hit Teddy as a storm hits the island, and he and Chuck discover that they\'re stranded.

Rather than report the discovery to the police, Moss decides to simply take the two million dollars present for himself. This puts the psychopathic killer, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), on his trail as he dispassionately murders nearly every rival, bystander and even employer in his pursuit of his quarry and the money. As Moss desperately attempts to keep one step ahead, the blood from this hunt begins to flow behind him with relentlessly growing intensity as Chigurh closes in. Meanwhile, the laconic Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) blithely oversees the investigation even as he struggles to face the sheer enormity of the crimes he is attempting to thwart.\r\n-\r\nJosh Brolin\r\n\r\n1980, West Texas. While out hunting down by the US-Mexico border, good ol\' Texas boy Llewelyn Moss, a welder by day who lives in a trailer park in Sanderson with his wife Carla Jean, comes across what is a drug deal gone wrong. What he finds are all the players left at the scene dead or near death and a satchel filled with $2 million which he takes, despite knowing that someone will be looking for the money and is probably willing to kill for it. As such, he not only tries to protect himself in the process of trying to find out who will be after the money, but also Carla Jean by sending her away. A person hired to retrieve the money is Anton Chigurh, who indeed will kill anyone, including innocent bystanders, necessary to get to his end goal, with a high pressure air pistol his weapon of choice especially as it leaves no bullet as evidence. Chigurh, in deciding who should live or die in his day to day life, also uses his own psychopathic set of principles. Chirgurh quickly learns that Moss has the money and is on the run. Also on both their trails is Terrell County Sheriff Ed Tom Bell and his naive deputy Wendell. Bell, a third generation sheriff, has of late contemplated his professional future solely because of the notion that he and his like have not been able to do anything to control the increasing violence of the region. Bell finds evidence that Moss has the money and that someone, who has left a trail of carnage behind him, is after Moss and the money. As such, Bell tries to find Moss solely to protect him from whoever is after him. One other person added to the mix is Carson Wells, hired by the same person that hired Chigurh also to retrieve the money, as their employer feels that Chigurh has gotten out of control. Wells knows Chigurh well and knows that he will not take too kindly to anyone else brought in on his job.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nIn the desert of Rio Grande, a drug deal goes wrong and Llewellyn Moss, the welder, finds 2 million dollars in a box. He keeps the money for himself but an unemotional psychopathic killer Chigurh chases him. He kills everyone that comes in front of him to get the welder, using a unique weapon of his own. By this time the elderly sheriff Ed Tom tries to go through and to as deed as possible of the matter.\r\n\r\nAfter stumbling across a case of money among dead bodies, Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) thinks he can keep it quiet, but when silent killer Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) locates Moss and his money, Vietnam veteran Moss makes a run for it. With bodies falling everywhere Anton goes, it\'s only a matter of time before he catches up with Llewelyn. Whilst all this is going on, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is overseeing the investigation and begins to see the country in a different light than it once was.\r\n-\r\nJosh Brolin\r\n\r\nAfter he finds $2 million in the desert where a drug deal has apparently gone wrong, working man Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) finds himself on the run. His pursuer is Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), an unemotional killer with a unique murder weapon at his disposal. Throughout, soon to be retired Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) attempts to convince Moss, mostly through his wife Carla Jean, that he should turn the money over to the authorities or this could all end in tragedy.\r\n-\r\nJosh Brolin', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-20 14:06:27', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 1, 'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nAustria::16\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-15\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-13\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nIceland::16\r\nIreland::15A\r\nIsrael::16\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nJapan::R-15\r\nMalaysia::18PL\r\nMexico::C\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPortugal::M/18\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::NC-16\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::18\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nTaiwan::R-18\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R', 16),

Later, all three unexpectedly find themselves working together in a joint mission to stop a private criminal organization from using Gaby\'s father\'s scientific expertise to construct their own nuclear bomb. Through clenched teeth and stylish poise, all three must find a way to cooperate for the sake of world peace, even as they each pursue their own agendas.\r\n-\r\nKenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com)\r\n\r\nIn the 60\'s, the CIA agent Napoleon Solo is assigned to bring the mechanic Gaby Teller from East Berlin to the other side of the wall. Gaby is the daughter of the scientist and American collaborator Udo Teller that defected from German at the end of WWII and now has vanished. They are chased by KGB agent Illya Kuryakin but they succeed to escape. Soon Napoleon Solo\'s chief Saunders discloses that Gaby\'s uncle Rudi works for the wealthy Alexander and his wife Victoria Vinciguerra and Udo might be secretly building a nuclear weapon for them. Napoleon Solo is forced to team-up with Illya and Gaby and they go to Rome to investigate.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\n1963, the height of the Cold War. In an unlikely alliance, a CIA agent, Napoleon Solo and KGB agent, Illya Kuryakin, band together to save the world from nuclear disaster. A top nuclear scientist, formerly employed by the US, has gone missing. It is suspected his brother has kidnapped him to work on a nuclear bomb. Solo and Kuryakin accompany the scientist\'s daughter, Gaby, to Rome, as this is where her uncle is based. The idea is to covertly investigate his company and, hopefully, find the scientist and the bomb. Things aren\'t all plain sailing though. This is heightened by the fact that Solo and Kuryakin aren\'t sure they can trust each other and, to some extent, still regard each other as enemies.\r\n-\r\ngrantss\r\n\r\n1963. Napoleon Solo is a suave and urbane C.I.A. agent. He was once a criminal, but the C.I.A. believed his unique talents would be of better service to the country as a spy than they would be if he was behind bars. His current case is to locate Dr. Udo Teller, a famed German rocket scientist who had been working for the Americans on their nuclear program since the end of WWII until he disappeared without a trace two years ago, that is until he was recently photographed in Rome. Napoleon manages to smuggle Teller\'s biological daughter, Gaby Schmidt, out of East Berlin to the west in order to locate Teller. The Americans don\'t believe she knows anything about his whereabouts - her father who she has not seen or heard from in eighteen years - but that she can influence some who do, namely her Uncle Rudi who is an executive at Rome-based Vinciguerra Shipping, owned and operated by husband and wife Alexander and Victoria Vinceguerra. The company is purportedly the front for the development of nuclear weapons, the major national intelligence agencies suspecting that Victoria, the brains behind the operation, having kidnapped Teller to build her an atom bomb. Because of the global implications, Napoleon is forced to work on this case with KGB agent Illya Kuryakin. Beyond the east-west divide between the Americans and Soviets, Napoleon will have a difficult time working with his new partner due to their recent not so pleasant encounter in East Berlin, and Illya\'s volatile and violent temper, which can cloud what he does professionally. As Napoleon, Illya and Gaby work on the case - their success or failure which may determine world order - what happens is affected by other players in the picture which they do not know about, and the Americans and Soviets working arguably on their own different agendas.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nDuring the taut East-West relations and the volatile early-1960s Cold War climate, the former thief and now suave CIA agent, Napoleon Solo, manages to transport Gaby Teller, the daughter of an ex-Nazi scientist, from East Berlin to West Germany, as the KGB spy, Illya Kuryakin, is hot on their trail. However, before the imminent threat of a global nuclear Armageddon, America and the Soviet Union order the two operatives to join forces in an unprecedented joint mission. Now, Solo and Kuryakin will have to endure each other for the common good and hope that their frail truce lasts. Can they thwart the elusive adversary\'s plans, especially when both governments have hidden agendas?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-21 01:52:49', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::12\r\nIndonesia::D\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::12\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nThailand::G\r\nTurkey::13A\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nVietnam::C16', 13),

The survivors, led by the second-in-command Carolyn Fry (\'Rahda Mitchell\' ), find themselves on a hot and arid landscape with constant sunlight from three orbiting suns. Fry not only must help the survivors find food and water, but contend with a deadly criminal, named Riddick (Vin Diesel), who was being transported to a prison cell on their destination. But every 22 years, the planet\'s three suns go into a total eclipse for a month where darkness brings out the planet\'s real inhabitants; large, reptilian, vampire-like creatures that come out and dominate the surface in total darkness, killing and eating all life.

Now Ripley must decide where her allegiance lies.\r\n\r\nEllen Ripley sacrificed herself to destroy the Company\'s desires to use the alien queen as a biological weapon. 200 years and seven horrible experiments later, she is resurrected on the USM Auriga using blood samples from Fiorina 161, for the purpose of extracting the alien queen inside her. However, Ripley\'s DNA gets mixed up with the Queen\'s DNA and she begins to develop enhanced strength and reflexes. After a band of smugglers, hired by the government, bring the crew of a hijacked transport to the Auriga, all hell breaks loose when the aliens breed from the hijacked crew escape. When the Auriga is set on automatic pilot back to Earth, it\'s up to Ripley and the smugglers to stop the Auriga and escape with their lives. And when the Queen\'s secret was revealed, it exposed a bizarre DNA mix-up that left both Ripley and the queen\'s genetics intertwined; giving light to an alien that could spell doom for Earth.\r\n-\r\nKerwin Tsang\r\n\r\nIt is 200 years since Ellen Ripley sacrificed herself to destroy the alien queen on Fiorina 161. Ripley\'s former employers, the Weyland-Yutani Company has dissolved and now the United Systems Military has assumed the task of breeding and harnessing the deadly aliens. With blood samples taken from her previous life, scientists clone a new Ripley in order to extract the alien queen inside of her. The new Ripley, known as Number 8, acquires physical and emotional traits from both humanity and the aliens, making her question where her allegiances lie. Shortly after, the aliens break free and commence killing those onboard. Along with a crew of smugglers that unknowingly helped in delivering hosts to breed the alien species, Ripley must now escape the perilous ship. Along the way, Ripley encounters a shocking revelation that truly sets herself against both humanity and the alien species. She must now decide what she truly is, in order to save humanity once more.\r\n-\r\nChris Broz', 'Blu-ray', 1, 0, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-27 13:18:56', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::13+\r\nCzech Republic::15\r\nFinland::K-15\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::18\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::18\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::R-15\r\nMexico::A\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::18\r\nPhilippines::R-18\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::18\r\nSweden::15\r\nUnited Kingdom::18\r\nUnited States::TV-PG', 12),

Instead, a rogue transmission entices the crew to a nearby habitable planet which resembles Earth.

Ultimately, what was intended as a peaceful exploratory mission, will soon turn into a desperate rescue operation in uncharted space.\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nIt is the year 2104. The spaceship Covenant is headed for a remote planet in order to colonise it. The ship\'s captain is killed in a freak accident, leaving the Executive Officer in charge.

In 2104, ten years after the Prometheus expedition, the colonization ship Covenant is seven years from reaching planet Origae-6, with 2,000 colonists in stasis and 1,140 human embryos in cold storage. The ship is monitored by Walter, an advanced android model that physically resembles David. When a shock-wave damages the ship, Walter reanimates his 14 human crew mates, themselves couples/colonists. Ship\'s captain Jake Branson dies when his stasis pod malfunctions. While repairing the ship, the crew picks up a transmission of a human voice from a nearby planet, which appears eminently more habitable than Origae-6. Despite the protests of Daniels, Branson\'s widow, that this new \"perfect\" planet is too good to be true, newly-promoted captain Chris Oram decides that they will check the new planet..\r\n\r\nThe crew of the colony ship Covenant, bound for a remote planet on the far side of the galaxy, discovers what they think is an uncharted paradise, but is actually a dark, dangerous world.

When he gets out he wants to be on the straight and narrow for his daughter but having a record doesn\'t help. And his ex-wife refuses to let him see his daughter because he can\'t find a regular job. Eventually his friend tells him of a job and he decides to take it. Scott has to break into a vault and when he does all he finds is a weird suit. After he takes it, he puts it on and discovers it shrinks him. Scott tries to return it and when he does he\'s arrested, a man claiming to be his attorney goes to see him and he tells him that the suit was an opportunity which he should have taken. Later some ants bring him the suit and he puts it on and gets out of jail. He then goes to the man who says he\'s Hank Pym the man who created the suit. He used it before and called himself Ant-Man. He gave it up when he found out people were planning to use his technology for things he doesn\'t think is right so he made sure no one could replicate it and put it away. But he now needs Scott to be Ant-Man because it seems like his protÃ©gÃ©, Darren Cross, who forced him out of his company, is close to replicating it. So he wants Scott to get into the lab and take it. Scott is uncertain if he can do it and Pym\'s daughter who thinks she should be the one to go agrees. But Pym thinks Scott is the one. So they train him while trying to make sure Cross doesn\'t suspect anything.\r\n-\r\nrcs0411@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nIn 1989, the scientist Dr. Hank Pym quits working for the S.H.I.E.L.D. when he discovers that they have unsuccessfully tried to replicate his shrinking technology named Ant-Man that he considers too dangerous for mankind. In the present days, Dr. Pym was forced by his daughter Hope van Dyne and his former protÃ©gÃ© Darren Cross to leave his company Pym Technologies to them. Further, he finds that Darren is developing his own shrinking technology named Yellowjacket. Meanwhile, the small-time criminal Scott Lang is released from prison and welcomed by his former cell mate Luis that wants him to participate in a heist. However Scott wants to find an honest job to take care of his beloved daughter Cassie that lives with his estranged wife Maggie and her future husband Detective Paxton. However his criminal record does not give a chance to him and he accepts to participate in the heist of the house of a millionaire. He finds only a special suit in the safe and he is arrested again by the police. Soon he learns that he is part of the scheme plotted by Dr. Pym and Hope to make him a superhero wearing the suit and save the world destroying the Yellowjacket. Without any alternative, Scott is trained by Dr. Pym and Hope in the beginning of an incredible adventure.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nAfter serving a few years in prison, former burglar Scott Lang is released. Now wanting to be straight, Scott sets out to find himself a job. But he is totally unaware that his record is preventing him from working and seeing his young daughter Cassie. When he steals a powerful suit, he quickly returns it only to find himself arrested again. But a mysterious man named Hank Pym has other ideas for him. Pym explains that it has the power to shrink in size and increase in strength due to a special formula called the Pym Particle. He was once its owner and called himself Ant-Man. Unfortunately during his SHIELD days, Pym discovers that others wanted to replicate his design. Now Pym wants to use Scott to being the new Ant-Man because his former apprentice Darren Cross is working to replicate the formula for his own evil purposes.

They believe Pym\'s wife Janet van Dyne might be trapped there after shrinking to sub-atomic levels in 1987. When he had previously visited the quantum realm, Lang had unknowingly become quantum entangled with Janet, and now he receives an apparent message from her. With only days left of house arrest, Lang contacts Pym about Janet despite the strained relationship they have due to Lang\'s actions with the Avengers. Hope and Pym kidnap Lang, leaving a decoy so as not to arouse suspicion from FBI agent Jimmy Woo. Believing the message from Janet to be confirmation that she is alive, the trio work to build a stable tunnel so they can take a vehicle to the quantum realm and retrieve her. They arrange to buy a part needed for the tunnel from black market dealer Sonny Burch, who has realized the potential profit that can be earned from Pym\'s research and double-crosses them. Donning the Wasp outfit, Hope fights off Burch and his men until she is attacked by a quantum unstable masked woman.

The police dispense the crowd and Umberto returns to his cheap furnished room which he shares with his dog Flick. Umberto\'s lone friend is Maria, servant of the boarding house. She is a simple girl who is pregnant by one of two soldiers and neither will admit to being the father. When Umberto\'s landlady Antonia demands the rent owed her and threatens eviction if she is not paid, Umberto tries desperately to raise the money by selling his books and watch. He is too proud to beg in the streets and can not get a loan from any of his acquaintances. He contracts a sore throat, is admitted to a hospital and this puts a delay on his financial difficulty. Discharged, he finds that his dog is gone and, following a frantic search, locates him in the city dog pound. His room has been taken over by the landlady and the now-homeless Unberto determines to find a place for his beloved dog, and then kill himself. Unsuccessful, he resolves that his dog must die with him and he stands in the path of a train, with his dog in his arms.\r\n-\r\nLes Adams\r\n\r\nUmberto Domenico Ferrari is a retired civil servant who can barely eke out a living on his meager pension. He\'s behind on his rent and is now threatened with eviction. His only friends are his dog Flike and the young Maria who works as a kitchen maid in his rooming house. He\'s taken to selling what few possessions he has - his watch, a pair of cherished books - to pay part of his back rent but the landlady, Olga, insists he must pay her all he owes or she will evict him at the end of the month. Young Maria is pregnant, though she doesn\'t which of the two she\'s been seeing is the father and Umberto offers to help. When Umberto falls ill, he soon finds himself in hospital where he is found to have tonsillitis. He returns to his boarding house to himself without a place to stay and learns that his dog has run off. He finds Flike at the pound but must now rebuild his life.\r\n-\r\ngarykmcd\r\n\r\nAfter working thirty years as a dedicated civil servant, Umberto Domenico Ferrari lives solely off a meager Italian government pension. While most pensioners decry the small amount of money from the government, most are unlike Umberto who is in debt, the pension unable to pay off those debts and provide a healthy life for him. He is all alone in the world with no family. His only friends are his dog, a mutt named Flike, and Maria, the young, single maid who works in the house in which he\'s rented a room for twenty years. Umberto is close to being evicted by his haughty landlady, Olga, for rent not paid, she who has ulterior motives for wanting him out beyond the money. He has until the end of the month to come up with 15.000 lire for current and back rent or be evicted. Maria cannot help him, she who has her own secret which she confides to him, that issue which threatens her own position in the house. So Umberto does whatever he can either to raise the money, which is primarily through selling whatever of his possessions are worth anything monetarily, or cutting back on other expenses. One way he is able to achieve the latter is to parlay off of a case of tonsillitis. Through the process of this basic survival, Umberto will have to make some difficult and often heart wrenching decisions.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nBarely managing to support himself and his bright-eyed dog, Flike, Umberto Domenico Ferrari, a respectable civil servant who depends on his meagre and piteous pension, faces eviction by the end of the month. Under those circumstances, the desperate for cash lonely pensioner fights a losing battle to come by with the fifteen thousand lire to pay off his greedy and ruthless landlady, balancing between dignity and shame in the bustling streets of Rome.

But, who may know the whereabouts of Spots, the Isle of Dogs\' hapless prisoner zero?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nIn a dystopian near-future Japan, an influenza virus spreads throughout the canine population, with a risk of crossing to humans. The 6-term authoritarian mayor of Megasaki City, Kenji Kobayashi, signs a decree banishing all dogs to Trash Island, despite a scientist named Professor Watanabe insisting he is close to finding a cure for the dog flu. The first dog to be exiled is Spots, a white and black-speckled pink-nosed dog who served as the bodyguard of Atari Kobayashi, the orphaned nephew and ward of the mayor. Six months later, Atari steals a plane and flies to Trash Island to search for Spots. After crash-landing, Atari is rescued by a pack of dogs led by a seemingly black dog named Chief, who is a former stray. The pack decides to help Atari locate Spots, although Chief refuses to join because of his inability to fraternize with humans. Together, they fend off a rescue team accompanied by a robot dog that Kobayashi sent to retrieve Atari..', 'Blu-ray', 1, 0, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-30 00:44:57', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::PG\r\nAustria::10\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nColombia::7\r\nDenmark::7\r\nFinland::K-7\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::6\r\nGreece::K-13\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::12\r\nIndia::U\r\nIreland::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLuxembourg::6\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::A\r\nNetherlands::6\r\nNew Zealand::PG\r\nNorway::9\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Africa::10-12\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::A\r\nSweden::7\r\nTurkey::7+\r\nUnited Kingdom::PG\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUkraine::12\r\nVietnam::C13', 0),

He is about to shoot it, to take it back, as a specimen to the United Kingdom, when another bear playfully takes his gun away. He learns that this family of bears is intelligent and can learn English, and that they have a big appetite for marmalade. He names them Lucy (Imelda Staunton) and Pastuzo (Sir Michael Gambon). As he departs, he throws his hat to Pastuzo and tells the bears that they are always welcome should they wish to go to London. Several years later, the two bears are living in harmony with their nephew when an earthquake strikes their home, forcing them to seek shelter underground. After being trapped by a falling tree, Uncle Pastuzo is unable to reach the shelter in time and dies from his injuries. The next morning, Uncle Pastuzo\'s hat is found by his nephew, Paddington (Ben Whishaw). Aunt Lucy encourages her nephew to go and find solace in London, and stows him away on a cargo ship, after which she says she will move into the Home for Retired Bears.', 'Blu-ray', 1, 0, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-30 00:45:48', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::G\r\nAustria::6\r\nBrazil::Livre\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE\r\nDenmark::7\r\nFinland::K-7\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::0\r\nHong Kong::I\r\nHungary::6\r\nIreland::G\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::V\r\nMexico::A\r\nNetherlands::6\r\nNew Zealand::G\r\nNorway::7\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::7\r\nPortugal::M/6\r\nRussia::6+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Korea::All\r\nSpain::A\r\nSweden::7\r\nSwitzerland::0\r\nThailand::G\r\nUnited Kingdom::PG\r\nUnited States::PG', 0),

When fate places Remy in the sewers of Paris, he finds himself ideally situated beneath a restaurant made famous by his culinary hero, Auguste Gusteau. Despite the apparent dangers of being an unlikely, and certainly unwanted, visitor in the kitchen of a fine French restaurant, Remy\'s passion for cooking soon sets into motion a hilarious and exciting rat race that turns the culinary world of Paris upside down.\r\n-\r\nOrange\r\n\r\nWhen a rat named Remy gets washed away from his family, he ends up in Paris and goes into Gusteau\'s restaurant and meets a garbage boy named Linguini. A bunch of other chefs give him credit and give him a cooking job after thinking he made a soup delicious. Then Linguini takes Remy to the restaurant the next day. And Remy ends up controlling Linguini by pulling his hair. Can Remy be a great chef? and can Gusteau\'s be the greatest restaurant in Paris?\r\n\r\nRemy, a resident of Paris, appreciates good food and has quite a sophisticated palate. He would love to become a chef so he can create and enjoy culinary masterpieces to his heart\'s delight. The only problem is, Remy is a rat. When he winds up in the sewer beneath one of Paris\' finest restaurants, the rodent gourmet finds himself ideally placed to realize his dream.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nRemy, a provincial rat with a wonderful sense of smell, hates garbage and risks death to enter a human kitchen where he discovers real food and the cooking of five-star chef, Anton Gusteau, author of \"Anyone Can Cook\". On the day Remy learns his hero has died, he is evicted and ends up alone in Paris. By luck, he discovers Gasteau\'s restaurant, down to three stars and run by a frozen-food-hawking chef. As Remy enters, so does Linguini, a clumsy youth hired as a garbage boy. To save the soup that Linguini accidentally fouls, Remy throws in some ingredients; the soup is a success and Linguini\'s career as a chef is born. Can Remy find a way to maintain the fiction and use his gift?\r\n-\r\n\r\nRemy is a rat, constantly risking life in an expensive French restaurant because of his love of good food, as well as a desire to become a chef. Yet, obviously, this is a rather tough dream for a rat. But opportunity knocks when a young boy, who desperately needs to keep his job at the restaurant, despite his lack of cooking abilities, discovers and partners the young Remy. Its up to the two of them to avoid the insane head chef, bring the rest of Remy\'s family up to his standards, win his partner a girl, and, of course, produce the finest Ratatouille in all of France.\r\n-\r\nswansongang', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-30 00:46:37', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::PG\r\nBrazil::Livre\r\nCanada::G\r\nFinland::K-3\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::0\r\nHong Kong::I\r\nIceland::L\r\nIreland::G\r\nLithuania::V\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::A\r\nNetherlands::AL\r\nNew Zealand::PG\r\nNorway::7\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::G\r\nPortugal::M/6\r\nRussia::0+\r\nSingapore::G\r\nSouth Africa::PG\r\nSouth Korea::All\r\nSpain::T\r\nSweden::7\r\nSwitzerland::0\r\nTaiwan::GP\r\nUnited Kingdom::U\r\nUnited States::G', 0),

His bossy, jealous wife Cate initially makes Parker swear it won\'t stay, but by the time its\' clear nobody will claim him and an adoption candidate is found, she agrees to keep the dog, who won over their daughter Andy and her fiance Michael at first sight. Parker\'s Japanese college friend Ken inspires naming the pup Hachi(ko), and is pleasantly surprised when Parker successfully tackles the challenge to get it to fetch, which Akitas don\'t usually do. Hachi makes a habit of waiting for his equally doting master at the station every evening, but after a cardiac crisis, Parker dies. Hachi refuses to accept this, being moved to Michael\'s home as Cate moves out, waiting for a master who can never come home again, by now collectively adopted by sympathizing town-folk. The story is told in flashbacks as class assignment \'my hero\' by Michael\'s teen son Robbie, who also gets an Akita puppy.\r\n-\r\nKGF Vissers\r\n\r\nA schoolboy reports on his hero: Hachiko, his grandfather\'s dog. In a flashback, a puppy at a Japanese monastery is crated and sent to the US. The crate\'s tag tears, and when the puppy pushes his way out of the crate at the train station of a small Rhode Island town, Parker Wilson, a professor of music in nearby Providence, takes the dog home for the night. His wife isn\'t happy about it, but after failing to find the owner, she lets the dog stay. A Japanese friend reads the dog\'s tag - \"Hachiko\" or \"Eight,\" a lucky number. Parker can\'t teach the dog to fetch, but the friend explains that the dog will forge a different kind of loyalty. Tragedy tests that loyalty.\r\n-\r\n\r\nEleven year old Robbie is giving an oral class report on the topic of \"My Hero\", his chosen subject, Hachi, who on the surface is an unusual choice. Several years earlier, Parker Wilson, who lives in Bedridge in suburban New York City, is a college music/performing arts professor, he who makes the train commute to/from the city every working day. It is on one of those routine days going home that he finds at the Bedridge Station a puppy, who he eventually will learn was being shipped somewhere unknown, with the shipping tag lost. He also learns from Ken, a Japanese professor friend, that the dog is a Japanese breed called an Akita, and that the Japanese character on the dog\'s collar tag is the number eight - \"hachi\". Parker does whatever he can to find out who the dog belongs to, and although his many acquaintances around the train station do their small part in helping Parker, no one is willing to take the dog, even temporarily. So Parker takes the dog home, despite he and his wife Cate long having dismissed the idea of having a dog. However Parker is able to convince her to let the dog stay temporarily. Eventually on the high probability that they will never find the dog\'s owner, Cate, upon seeing the interaction between the two, lets Parker permanently keep the dog, who he has since named Hachi. Although living in the Wilson home with Parker, Cate and their daughter Andy, Hachi becomes not a Wilson family pet, not Cate\'s, not Andy\'s, but Parker\'s alone as a special bond forms between the two. Although not a \"typical\" dog in that Hachi will do not what most dogs do such as fetch, Hachi demonstrates an unwavering and lifelong loyalty to Parker in an unusual way that all around him can see. Robbie chose Hachi as his hero because of this loyalty, despite he never having met Parker, who in nonetheless an important part of his life.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nBefore the entire class, young Ronnie tells the story of his grandfather\'s exceptional Akita dog. As Ronnie starts to recount the chance encounter of his grandfather, the college music teacher, Parker Wilson, with the abandoned puppy that accidentally ended up in the professor\'s hometown of Rhode Island, an incredible story of loyalty and devotion begins to unfold. Indeed, at first, Parker intended to find the dog\'s owner; but, instead, after realising that nobody claims the dog, he decided to keep the abandoned puppy, naming it Hachiko. Then, tragedy struck, giving the perfect example of the strong, the unwavering, and sometimes, the unexplainable bond that can form between a man and an animal.\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas', 'Blu-ray', 1, 0, '', 0, '2020-05-01', '', '2020-04-30 00:49:19', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::G\r\nBrazil::Livre\r\nFinland::K-3\r\nGermany::0\r\nGreece::K-8\r\nHong Kong::I\r\nIreland::G\r\nItaly::T\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::A\r\nNetherlands::AL\r\nNorway::7\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::0+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Korea::All\r\nSpain::T\r\nSweden::Btl\r\nUnited Kingdom::U\r\nUnited States::G', 0),

His association with the role took over his life, where Birdman is more renowned than \"Riggan Thomson\" the actor. Now past middle age, Riggan is trying to establish himself as a true artist by writing, directing, starring in and co-producing with his best friend Jake what is his Broadway debut, an adaptation of Raymond Carver\'s story, What We Talk About When We Talk About Love. He is staking his name, what little artistic reputation that comes with that name and his life savings on the project, and as such will do anything needed to make the play a success. As he and Jake go through the process of the previews toward opening night, Riggan runs into several issues: needing to find a replacement for the integral supporting male role the night before the first preview; hiring the talented Broadway name, Mike Shiner, for that role, Mike who ends up being difficult to work with and who may end up overshadowing Riggan in the play; having to deal potentially with a lawsuit based on one of his actions to ensure success; needing to be there for his daughter, Sam, who he has hired to be his production assistant and who has just come out of drug rehab; and pleasing the New York Times critic, Tabitha Dickinson, who wants to use any excuse to give the play a scathing review which in turn would close the show after the opening night performance. But Riggan\'s biggest problem may be his own insecurities, which are manifested by him constantly hearing what he believes to be the truth from the voice of his Birdman character, who he often battles both internally and externally.\r\n-\r\nRaymond Carver\r\n\r\nRiggan is a man struggling to make his mark in the world. Having achieved fame as \"Birdman\", he voluntarily walked away from the on screen role, and battled the inner voices that had him believe he was more powerful than anyone could imagine. Old, irrelevant, but still driven, Riggan has chosen to pursue his dream of honoring the man who inspired him over 20 years ago. Riggan and those around him are all facing similar battles, but seem to be unaware of any but their own. Determined to make his play a success, he overcomes obstacle after obstacle in order to ensure it is a success on the stage. Surrounded by his daughter and the actors he\'s chosen, Riggan works to come to terms with the realities of life. Moments of brutal honesty affect him and those around him. Nearly everyone finds themselves in both positions, of giving and receiving the words they need to hear in that moment. Riggan attempts to let himself truly feel what he needs to so he can find inner peace and freedom. Opening night finds him offering the performance of his life for more reasons than one, and the success of that night will make or break the future of his play. Like everything else, his handling of events is affected by demons only he is aware of.\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan\r\n\r\nRiggan Thomson is an actor who played the famous and iconic superhero \"Birdman\" over 20 years ago. Now, in his middle-age, he is directing his debut on Broadway, a drama called \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\", an adaptation from a Raymond Carver story. With the help of his assistant and daughter Sam, and his producer Jake, he will play out the show previews, even when a talented actor he hired on, Mike Shiner act arbitrarily, the internal issues between him and the other casts, his useless maximum efforts to critics, and the unexpected voices of his old character- the Birdman, pushing his sanity until the first debut show.\r\n-\r\nGusde\r\n\r\nFormer cinema superhero Riggan Thomson is mounting an ambitious Broadway production that he hopes will breathe new life into his stagnant career. It\'s risky, but he hopes that his creative gamble will prove that he\'s a real artist and not just a washed-up movie star. As opening night approaches, a cast mate is injured, forcing Riggan to hire an actor who is guaranteed to shake things up. Meanwhile, Riggan must deal with his girlfriend, daughter and ex-wife.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nA washed up actor tries to reclaim his fame on Broadway with a new play.

Vincent Hanna and his team of cops in the Robbery/Homicide police division. A botched job puts Hanna onto their trail while they regroup and try to put together one last big \'retirement\' score. Neil and Vincent are similar in many ways, including their troubled personal lives. At a crucial moment in his life, Neil disobeys the dictum taught to him long ago by his criminal mentor--\'Never have anything in your life that you can\'t walk out on in thirty seconds flat, if you spot the heat coming around the corner\'--as he falls in love. Thus the stage is set for the suspenseful ending....\r\n-\r\nTad Dibbern\r\n\r\nNeil McCauley leads a group of professional bank robbers, taking down major scores around LA. However after their latest heist goes terribly wrong and ends up in homicide, Det. Vincent Hannah finds a clue and becomes obsessed with the case determined to stop McCauley\'s crew. Hannah and McCauley are competing against each other in a deadly cat-and-mouse game. Although they are on different sides of the law, they still find huge respect, recognition in each others troubled personal lives and they understand each others motivations - however this won\'t make them hesitate to do whatever they can to win the battle between them two in this crime saga.\r\n-\r\nJulian Olin\r\n\r\nNeil McCauley is a thief... an expert thief... one of the best. His philosophy in life - become attached to nothing in life that you can\'t walk away from in 30 seconds if you spot the \"Heat\" around the corner. His crew of criminals is a high-tech outfit pulling off professional jobs that impress even the likes of Detective Vincent Hanna. But Hanna, a man driven through life only by his work, becomes obsessed, at the expense of his private life, with bringing McCauley down. As McCauley\'s crew prepare for the score of a lifetime, and Hanna\'s team tries to bring him in, the two find that they are challenged by the greatest minds on the opposite side of the law that either one has ever encountered.\r\n-\r\nMichael Silva  updated for proper content by vedwed\r\n\r\nIn Los Angeles, a gang of armed thieves is hitting serious targets - major banks, vaults, and armored cars.

Theirs is a close-knit Christian community. Samantha, a stay-at-home wife and mother which allows her to prioritize her time on Hannah, earns extra income by doing sewing for their neighbors and selling things she makes at craft fairs, they relying on Curtis\' job for a drilling company not only for its income but more importantly for its generous extended health benefits which in combination and still at great financial expense to them will allow them to get a cochlear implant for Hannah, the surgery scheduled for six weeks\' time. One night, Curtis has a nightmare, it of a massive storm producing a golden oily rain followed by an act of violence as a response to the storm. Each successive night he has versions of this same nightmare, always with a massive storm and its golden oily rain followed by a resulting act or threat of violence. During this time, he also notices unusual natural occurrences during his waking hours which only he seems to be experiencing, he unable to distinguish between reality and the nightmares when they are happening, he waking up in a cold sweat from the nightmares and being able to feel the effects of those violent acts in the nightmares for the remainder of the day. He doesn\'t tell Samantha of anything through which he is going. He tries to remove the perpetrators of those violent acts from his life, they more often than not friends and/or loved ones. He begins to think that he is suffering from mental illness, specifically schizophrenia, he having a family history of it, his mother Sarah who was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic twenty-five years ago and who still lives in assisted care. Regardless, he still can\'t help but believe that an apocalyptic storm of some sort will occur, his daytime visions and nightmares signs of it.

Gordo overhears their address and brings gifts for the couple, making Simon uncomfortable. Then he invites the couple to have dinner with him and they learn that Gordo lives in a mansion. He receives a phone call and leaves the couple alone at his home and Simon decides to snoop around and mock him. When Gordo returns, Simon says that he should stay away from Robyn and him.

However the dog returns and the couple receive a letter of apology from Gordo telling to let bygones be bygones. Robyn is curious about the meaning but she gets pregnant.

Simon bumps into someone he knew at school, 20 years ago - Gordon (Joel Edgerton). Gordon starts sending the couple gifts and starts dropping around their house unexpectedly. Initially they are happy to humour him but he is not really a friend of theirs and is a bit creepy, so they ask him to stay away from them. Gordon obliges but from his parting note Robyn thinks that there may be an incident in Simon and Gordon\'s schooldays that Simon doesn\'t want to talk about. So she starts investigating...\r\n-\r\ngrantss\r\n\r\nWritten and directed by Joel Edgerton, The Gift centers around a young married couple Simon (Jason Bateman) and Robyn (Rebecca Hall). Simon has a chance encounter with a former acquaintance, the off-kilter Gordo (Edgerton), who begins to surprise the couple with unwanted and increasingly menacing gifts. Eventually, Gordo also reveals a hidden secret from Simon\'s past and throws the couple\'s lives into a tailspin..\r\n\r\nIn need of a fresh start, the sales executive, Simon, and his beautiful interior-designer wife, Robyn, relocate from Chicago to Simon\'s hometown of Los Angeles. However, sometimes, putting the past behind is easier said than done--and as an ordinary day out shopping leads to a chance encounter with Simon\'s old high-school friend, Gordo--pretty soon, things will take a turn for the unexpected. Now, an endless string of increasingly lavish house-warming gifts disrupts the couple\'s peace, against the backdrop of a delicate but inviolable secrecy.

Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. Son of legendary inventor and weapons contractor Howard Stark. When Tony Stark is assigned to give a weapons presentation to an Iraqi unit led by Lt. Col. James Rhodes, he\'s given a ride on enemy lines. That ride ends badly when Stark\'s Humvee that he\'s riding in is attacked by enemy combatants. He survives - barely - with a chest full of shrapnel and a car battery attached to his heart. In order to survive he comes up with a way to miniaturize the battery and figures out that the battery can power something else. Thus Iron Man is born. He uses the primitive device to escape from the cave in Iraq. Once back home, he then begins work on perfecting the Iron Man suit. But the man who was put in charge of Stark Industries has plans of his own to take over Tony\'s technology for other matters.\r\n-\r\nhalo1k\r\n\r\nAfter being kidnapped by a powerful terrorist organization, brilliant industrialist Tony Stark narrowly escapes using an iron suit he crafted from scrap metal and spare parts. Upon returning home, he devotes all of his time and resources to perfecting the iron man suit, and using it to fight evil, sometimes in the place where he least expects it.\r\n\r\nBillionaire, genius, playboy, philanthropist? All this and more sums up Tony Stark. After a weapons presentation in Iraq, Stark gets himself captured which also results in him having a chest filled with shrapnel. Needing to escape, he miniaturizes it and dons a suit of armor. This results in the birth of the Armored Avenger Iron Man. Once returned safely, Stark works to perfect his design and uses it to protect all mankind. This activity catches the eye of a mysterious organization known as SHIELD. On the other hand, the chairman of Stark Industries discovers this and has plans of his own for Tony\'s work.\r\n-\r\nBlazer346', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-06-23', '', '2020-05-14 04:20:38', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::14+\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-7\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::11\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::G\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::14+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Africa::10\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::7\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nVietnam::C13', 12),

When Stark finds his personal world destroyed at his enemy\'s hands, he embarks on a harrowing quest to find those responsible. This journey, at every turn, will test his mettle. With his back against the wall, Stark is left to survive by his own devices, relying on his ingenuity and instincts to protect those closest to him. As he fights his way back, Stark discovers the answer to the question that has secretly haunted him: does the man make the suit or does the suit make the man?\r\n-\r\nJawadjee\r\n\r\nThe events of Loki\'s attack on New York City has left Tony Stark a completely changed man. Now saddled with a severe case of insomnia and post traumatic stress disorder, Tony spends his sleepless nights the only way he knows how - coming up with new prototypes for the Iron Man suit. But now new events require that Tony suit up again. A villainous mad man known only as the Mandarin has staged a horrible attack on the Chinese Theater in Los Angeles, and is coming for Tony. An angry Tony wants to confront the Mandarin face to face, who proceeds to stage an attack on Tony\'s Malibu mansion and leaves him with absolutely nothing - no Pepper, no toys except for a defunct Iron Man prototype called the MK42, and he\'s stranded in the middle of Tennessee. Tony believes the attack on the Chinese Theater and an attack on a small town in Tennessee are related. As he puts the pieces together and tries to get the MK42 working, he discovers far more sinister forces at work greater than the Mandarin himself. But how does an event from Tony\'s past fit in with the events of the present?\r\n-\r\nhalo1k\r\n\r\nIn Malibu California, Tony Stark has insomnia and over 72 hours he develops the new prototype MK42 of the Iron Man armature. He also recalls events in 1999, in Bern, Switzerland, when he had one night stand with the genetic scientist Maya Hansen that was researching a regenerative process and made fun of his fan Aldrich Killian on the New Year eve. There are explosions in Los Angeles and the terrorist Mandarin assumes the attempts broadcasting through television. When Tony\'s bodyguard and friend Happy Hogan is seriously wounded in an explosion, Tony Stark challenges Mandarin and gives his address to him. However, three helicopters attack his mansion and he loses everything but his prototype, and he awakes in the Tennessee. Tony tries to make work the defective prototype and soon he discovers that the event from 1999 is connected to the present terrorist attacks.\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan\r\n\r\nAfter saving New York from an alien invasion, billionaire Tony Stark buries himself deeper into his work by building a ton of new and improved Iron Man suits. He also starts having constant nightmares and doesn\'t know why. But deep in the shadows, a new menace called the Mandarin starts orchestrating a series of terrorist attacks all over the world. When his home is demolished and his suits are destroyed, Stark begins a personal journey to finding out the truth about the bombings and tracking down whoever is truly responsible. Little does Stark know however is that someone else from his past has his own plans against him and proves to be even more powerful than Stark realizes.\r\n-\r\nBlazer346\r\n\r\nTony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) wrestles with inner demons while contending with monsters of his own creation in this sequel from writerdirector Shane Black. The story in Iron Man 3 picks up shortly after the events of The Avengers. Having previously entered another dimension in order to save New York City, Tony remains deeply haunted by the experience. Unable to sleep, he throws himself into his work with such intensity that it begins to take a heavy toll on both his mental health and his relationship with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Tony has only started to appreciate the gravity of his problems when an enigmatic terrorist named the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) hijacks the airwaves and threatens to bring America to its knees with a painful series of \"lessons\" that even President Ellis (William Sadler) won\'t be able to ignore. When Tony\'s former security guard Happy Hogan (Favreau) is badly injured in an explosion caused by one of the Mandarin\'s agents, the vengeful playboy issues a public threat that results in his home being completely destroyed in a devastating attack, leaving him to face his enemy with only one badly damaged prototype suit. Fortunately, Tony isn\'t on his own, and with the help of Col. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) and a young boy named Harley (Ty Simpkins), he pieces together the mystery of the Mandarin, whose final \"lesson\" promises to be the most painful of all..', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-06-08', '', '2020-05-14 04:22:14', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::G\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::13+\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMaldives::15+\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::11\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::G\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Africa::10-12\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nThailand::G\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nVietnam::C13', 12),

The one hope, the only hope: THE EXORCIST', 'When a 12 year-old girl is possessed by a mysterious entity, her mother seeks the help of two priests to save her.', 'When a 12 year-old girl is possessed by a mysterious entity, her mother seeks the help of two priests to save her.\r\n-\r\npaulrichard\r\n\r\nA visiting actress in Washington, D.C., notices dramatic and dangerous changes in the behavior and physical make-up of her 12-year-old daughter. Meanwhile, a young priest at nearby Georgetown University begins to doubt his faith while dealing with his mother\'s terminal sickness. And, book-ending the story, a frail, elderly priest recognizes the necessity for a show-down with an old demonic enemy.\r\n-\r\nAndrew Harmon\r\n\r\nSeparated from her actor husband, Hollywood actress Chris MacNeil and her preteen daughter Regan are in Washington DC, where Chris is on an extended location shoot for a movie called \"Crash Course\". They have rented a brownstone in Georgetown as a place to live during the shoot, after which Chris plans to take Regan to Europe until their new house in Los Angeles is constructed. Chris continually hears noises in the middle of the night emanating from the attic, which she assumes is nothing more than a small infestation of rats. Concurrently, Regan, who had been an even keeled child, is showing periodic signs of unusual behavior, such as hyperactivity, swearing, lying and lack of concentration. The GP, Dr. Klein, who can only surmise the symptoms are a manifestation of stress from the separation and temporary move to DC away from her home, diagnoses her condition, solely based on the symptoms, as hyperkinesia. Despite Dr. Klein and other physicians trying to determine and explain Regan\'s increasingly abnormal and bizarre behavior with scientific theories, Chris begins to believe that there is more at play, especially as Regan\'s behavior ultimately includes violence and acts of superhuman strength, which can only be classified as other worldly which Regan herself could not have directly caused on her own, such as the rat-less noises in the attic. Despite having no religious convictions, Chris is convinced that since there is some other worldly force overtaking Regan, a course of action is to have that force - the demon - exorcised from Regan\'s being. Who contacts her is Father Damien Karras - also an M.D. who acts as a psychiatric counselor for the Catholic church - who Chris for whatever reason had been drawn to as a person she has seen in the neighborhood. Father Karras is facing his own crisis of faith upon the recent death of his mother. He needs not only the permission of the church to proceed but also his own faith that whatever he does will help as opposed to hurt Regan. Who the church also sends is Father Lankester Merrin, who may have a better understanding of what has possessed Regan and why it has chosen her, which is necessary to be able to combat it. The questions become whether Fathers Merrin and Karras have a strong enough faith to exorcise the demon and what they are willing to do to achieve their mission.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nMore and more, Regan, the otherwise happy twelve-year-old daughter of the successful actress, Chris MacNeil, is showing signs of erratic and disturbing behaviour, after an ill-advised contact with the supernatural. As a result, as the situation is rapidly getting out of hand, with perfectly healthy Regan becoming increasingly violent and obscene, desperate Chris is willing to do everything in her power to keep her child safe, including seeking spiritual help. Now, Chris\' only hope rests on the inexperienced Greek-American Catholic priest, Father Damien Karras, and the weary exorcist, Father Lankester Merrin, to perform the intricate purification rite that will rid Regan of the malevolent spirit that is tormenting her. But, can they confront the embodiment of evil?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nAccompanied by her 12 year-old daughter Regan, actress Chris McNeil relocates to Washington D.C. where she is filming a movie. Mother and daughter have a good relationship but after a time Regan begins to act strangely. She undergoes various neurological tests but doctors can find nothing to explain her behavior. As Regan\'s situation reaches crisis proportions - she has to be tied to her bed, swears like a sailor and speaks in tongues - Chris turns to Father Karras, a Roman Catholic priest and psychiatrist to see if an exorcism might be the solution to their problem. Karras is incredulous but the church eventually agrees calling in Father Merrin, who has previously conducted an exorcism and come face to face with the devil.\r\n-\r\ngarykmcd\r\n\r\nA movie actress taking up temporary residence in Washington D.C. has her troubles. The script for the movie she\'s filming seems inadequate. Her ex, who is also the father of her adolescent daughter, Regan, neglects to call the girl on her birthday. And the attic has rats. Meanwhile, Father Karras, a priest and a psychiatrist, is losing his faith; and he\'s dealing with a sick mother who needs medical care he hasn\'t the money to provide. Another priest, the old and ailing Father Merrin, has just returned from Iraq with forebodings of evil. These three persons meet when the sweet and cheerful Regan turns foul-mouthed and violent. But her sickness is beyond the reach of a medical doctor or a psychiatrist. What Regan needs is an exorcist.\r\n-\r\nJ.

Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi are sent to confront the leaders. But not everything goes to plan. The two Jedi escape, and along with their new Gungan friend, Jar Jar Binks head to Naboo to warn Queen Amidala, but droids have already started to capture Naboo and the Queen is not safe there. Eventually, they land on Tatooine, where they become friends with a young boy known as Anakin Skywalker. Qui-Gon is curious about the boy, and sees a bright future for him. The group must now find a way of getting to Coruscant and to finally solve this trade dispute, but there is someone else hiding in the shadows. Are the Sith really extinct? Is the Queen really who she says she is? And what\'s so special about this young boy?\r\n-\r\nsimon\r\n\r\nWhen the Trade Federation organize a blockade around the planet Naboo, the Supreme Chancellor Valorum sends the Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi to negotiate the end of the blockade. However the evil Viceroy Nute Gunray is ordered to kill the Jedi and invade Naboo. However the Jedi escape and Qui-Gon saves the life of the clumsy Gungan Jar Jar Binks. The outcast native takes the Jedi to his submerged city and the Gungan leader gives transportation to them. The Jedi head to the capital to warn Queen Amidala about the invasion. However she has been captured by the Federation droids but the Jedi rescue the queen and her court and they flee in a spacecraft that is damaged when they cross the blockade. They land on a desert planet and Qui-Gon Jinn goes to the town with Jar Jar, the droid R2-D2 and the queen\'s assistant PadmÃ© to seek the necessary part for the spacecraft. When they find the component, they do not have money to buy it. But the slave boy Anakin Skywalker offers to dispute a race with his pod to raise the necessary money. Qui-Gon feels the Force in the boy and accepts his offer. Will the boy win the race? What will happen to Naboo? Will Queen Amidala be capable to convince the politicians to release her planet from the Trade Federation?\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nWhen the evil Trade Federation plots to take over the peaceful planet of Naboo, Jedi warrior Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi embark on an amazing adventure to save the planet. With them on their journey is the young Queen Amidala, Gungan outcast Jar Jar Binks, and the powerful Captain Panaka, who will all travel to the faraway planets of Tatooine and Coruscant in a futile attempt to save their world from Darth Sidious, leader of the Trade Federation, and Darth Maul, the strongest Dark Lord of the Sith to ever wield a lightsaber.\r\n-\r\nAnchorhead\r\n\r\nAs imminent conflict brews between the powerful Trade Federation and the peaceful planet of Naboo, Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi travel to Naboo to warn the Queen of the galactic fallout which is to follow. Eventually, Naboo is invaded forcing the Jedi to evacuate the planet with the Queen and her court. They travel to the desert planet of Tatooine where they meet a slave boy named Anakin Skywalker who is evidently one with the Force. They enlist his help in fighting the war, while the Jedi confront one of the Dark Jedi behind the invasion, Darth Maul, while his master Darth Sidious continues to lead the invasion as a \"phantom\" behind the scenes.\r\n-\r\nMatthew McQuillan\r\n\r\nIt is a distant galaxy eons before the gestation of the planet Earth. Advancements in technology and science have allowed the evolution of millions of worlds that are otherwise in many respects still primitive. These worlds are somewhat loosely allied into a galactic Republic, whose capital world is the planet Coruscant, a planetary city. Upholding order for the Republic are the Jedi, an order of warriors endowed with near-super power derived from self-generated fields of energy known collectively as the Force. Within the Republic, dissident worlds have banded into an alliance known as the Trade Federation, and the Trade Federation is locked in a dispute with the peaceful world of Naboo. Two Jedi Knights, Qui-Gon Jinn and his youthful apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi, have been sent to Naboo to help mediate an end to the dispute, but Nute Gunray, an alien viceroy, orders them to be killed, and the two Jedi discover upon their escape that the Trade Federation will launch an invasion of Naboo. With the help of a well-meaning but hopelessly subliterate alien native of Naboo, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan land on Naboo to rescue her ruler, Queen Amidala, a ruler whose rule is a mixture of monarchy and republican democracy. Escaping Naboo, they are attacked by a Federation baseship and are forced to land on the distant planet Tatooine, where in seeking parts to complete their journey to Coruscant they encounter a young boy, Anakin Skywalker, a slave who possesses a gift for the savagely dangerous sport of podracing - a gift that Qui-Gon deduces is part of a genetic makeup perfect for the Jedi Order. Anakin eventually joins with Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan, and in the process attracts the attention of one of Queen Amidala\'s handmaidens with a dramatic secret, and all reach Coruscant, but endless and pointless debate within the Republic\'s Senate leave them no choice but to strike out on their own to liberate Naboo, a task made all the more difficult because a traitor within Coruscant has at his command a dissident Jedi warrior who seeks the death of Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan.\r\n-\r\nstp43', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-06-23', '', '2020-05-14 04:56:12', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::PG\r\nBelgium::KT/EA\r\nBrazil::Livre\r\nCanada::G\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::6\r\nHong Kong::I\r\nIceland::LH\r\nIndia::U\r\nIreland::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::A\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::PG\r\nNorway::11\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::G\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::0+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Africa::PG\r\nSouth Korea::All\r\nSpain::A\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::10\r\nUnited Kingdom::PG\r\nUnited States::PG\r\nUkraine::ZA', 0),

Upon arrival, she escapes from an attempt to kill her, and Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker are assigned to protect her. They chase the shape-shifter Zam Wessell but she is killed by a poisoned dart before revealing who hired her. The Jedi Council assigns Obi-Wan Kenobi to discover who has tried to kill Amidala and Anakin to protect her in Naboo. Obi-Wan discovers that the dart is from the planet Kamino, and he heads to the remote planet. He finds an army of clones that has been under production for years for the Republic and that the bounty hunter Jango Fett was the matrix for the clones. Meanwhile Anakin and Amidala fall in love with each other, and he has nightmarish visions of his mother. They travel to his home planet, Tatooine, to see his mother, and he discovers that she has been abducted by Tusken Raiders. Anakin finds his mother dying, and he kills all the Tusken tribe, including the women and children. Obi-Wan follows Jango Fett to the planet Geonosis where he discovers who is behind the Separatist movement. He transmits his discoveries to Anakin since he cannot reach the Jedi Council. Who is the leader of the Separatist movement? Will Anakin receive Obi-Wan\'s message? And will the secret love between Anakin and Amidala succeed?\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nTen years after the \'Phantom Menace\' threatened the planet Naboo, PadmÃ© Amidala is now a Senator representing her homeworld. A faction of political separatists, led by Count Dooku, attempts to assassinate her. There are not enough Jedi to defend the Republic against the threat, so Chancellor Palpatine enlists the aid of Jango Fett, who promises that his army of clones will handle the situation. Meanwhile, Obi-Wan Kenobi continues to train the young Jedi Anakin Skywalker, who fears that the Jedi code will forbid his growing romance with Amidala.\r\n-\r\nAnonymous\r\n\r\nJedi Knights Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker discover there is more than meets the eye behind an assassination attempt on Naboo Senator PadmÃ© Amidala\'s life. Meanwhile, a Sith Lord orchestrates events between the forces of good and evil, all the while waiting to play the final move that will ensure him control of the galaxy.\r\n-\r\nDoug Funnie\r\n\r\nSet ten years after the events in \"The Phantom Menace\". After an assassination attempt on the life of Senator PadmÃ© Amidala, Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan learner Anakin Skywalker are sent to investigate. After tracking down the assassin, she is killed before any information can be driven out of her. The two Jedi are then sent on two different missions: Anakin is sent to Naboo with PadmÃ© and Obi-Wan is sent to the planet of Kamino where he will investigate the assassination attempts. Little does he know, he is investigating some of the biggest events of the Star Wars saga, as he finds out that there is a connection between the assassination attempts and a separatist movement led by a former Jedi against the Republic. The Galactic Republic finds itself at the brink of a civil war.\r\n-\r\nChris Bierman\r\n\r\nAs now-Senator PadmÃ© Amidala returns to Coruscant to vote on an important Senatorial matter, an assassination attempt on her life prompts the Jedi Council to send Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker to protect her and find out who the assassin is. As this is happening, a rogue Jedi named Count Dooku leads separatists on Geonosis to rebel against the Senate. Supreme Chancellor Palpatine moves for a vote for a Republic Army to protect the Republic, as there has not been a full-scale war since the formation of the Republic. As Obi-Wan\'s investigations lead him to Kamino, he finds a massive clone army being produced, with a bounty hunter - the last of the Mandalorians - named Jango Fett as the master clone. As he chases the elusive bounty hunter, Jango (and his cloned son Boba) leads Obi Wan to Geonosis, where he meets Count Dooku and finds a startling revelation about the former Jedi. As Anakin is left behind to protect PadmÃ©, his feelings for her grow into something more than friendship. From Naboo to Tatooine, it grows into love for her. But when a tragedy strikes Anakin\'s life, he begins slipping away from the Light Side of the Force, and perhaps from the Force itself.\r\n-\r\nErik P', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-06-23', '', '2020-05-14 04:56:45', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::PG\r\nAustria::10\r\nBrazil::Livre\r\nCanada::G\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-11\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::I\r\nIceland::LH\r\nIndia::U\r\nIreland::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::A\r\nNetherlands::MG6\r\nNew Zealand::PG\r\nNorway::11\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::G\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::0+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Africa::PG\r\nSouth Korea::All\r\nSpain::T\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nUnited Kingdom::PG\r\nUnited States::PG\r\nUkraine::ZA', 0);

The plot then follows the life of a simple farm boy, Luke Skywalker, as he and his newly met allies (Han Solo, Chewbacca, Obi-wan Kenobi, C-3PO, R2-D2) attempt to rescue a rebel leader, Princess Leia, from the clutches of the Empire. The conclusion is culminated as the rebels, including Skywalker and flying ace Wedge Antilles make an attack on the Empire\'s most powerful and ominous weapon, the Death Star.\r\n-\r\nP.

He is desperate to get off this planet and get to the Academy like his friends, but his uncle needs him for the next harvest. Meanwhile, an evil emperor has taken over the galaxy, and has constructed a formidable \"Death Star\" capable of destroying whole planets. Princess Leia, a leader in the resistance movement, acquires plans of the Death Star, places them in R2-D2, a droid, and sends him off to find Obi-wan Kenobi. Before he finds him, R2-D2 ends up on the Skywalkers\' farm with his friend C-3PO. R2-D2 then wanders into the desert, and when Luke follows, they eventually come across Obi-wan. Will Luke, Obi-wan, and the two droids be able to destroy the Death Star, or will the Emperor rule forever?\r\n-\r\nColin Tinto\r\n\r\nPrincess Leia is held hostage by the evil forces of the Galactic Empire in their effort to take over the galaxy. Venturesome Luke Skywalker and dashing Captain Han Solo team together with the lovable robotic duo, R2-D2 and C-3PO, to rescue the beautiful Princess Leia and restore justice in the galaxy.\r\n-\r\nRobert Lynch\r\n\r\nIn a distant galaxy eons before the creation of the planet known as Earth, vast civilizations have evolved, and ruling the galaxy is an interstellar Empire created from the ruins of an Old Republic that held sway for generations. It is a time of civil war, as solar systems have broken away from the Empire and are waging a war of rebellion. During a recent battle, technical schematics for a gigantic space station, code named the Death Star, have been unearthed by rebel spies, and a young woman who is a dissident member of the Imperial Senate, under the cover of a diplomatic mission to the planet Alderaan, is trying to smuggle these plans to the rebellion. But her spacecraft is attacked by a vast warship of the Empire and seized. The dissident Senator is captured, but the plans for the Death Star are nowhere to be found. While soldiers of the Empire search the nearby planet Tatooine, a series of incidents sweeps up a young desert farmer with dreams of being a fighter pilot in the rebellion, as he winds up with the Death Star plans and also the assistance of an elderly hermit who once served as a warrior of an ancient order whose chosen weapons were powerful energy swords known as light-sabers. The pair recruit a cynical interstellar smuggler and his outsized alien copilot with an ancient freighter heavily modified for combat to help them reach Alderaan, but the planet is obliterated and now the foursome must rescue the young woman held prisoner by the Empire and lead an attack by the rebellion against the Death Star before it can annihilate all hope of restoring freedom to the galaxy.\r\n-\r\nMichael Daly', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-06-23', '', '2020-05-14 05:03:23', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::NRC\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::PG\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::6\r\nHong Kong::I\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::L\r\nIndia::U\r\nIreland::G\r\nItaly::T\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::AA\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::PG\r\nNorway::12\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::0+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Africa::PG\r\nSouth Korea::All\r\nSpain::A\r\nSweden::11\r\nUnited Kingdom::U\r\nUnited States::PG\r\nUkraine::ZA', 0),

Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca, and C-3PO escape in the Millennium Falcon, but are later captured by Darth Vader on Bespin. Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker and R2-D2 follow Obi-wan Kenobi\'s posthumous command, and receives Jedi training from Master Yoda on the swamp world of Dagobah. Will Skywalker manage to rescue his friends from the Dark Lord?\r\n-\r\nJames Pearce\r\n\r\nAfter receiving a vision from Obi-wan Kenobi and fleeing the ice world of Hoth with his friends after an Imperial attack, Luke Skywalker travels to the marsh planet of Dagobah, where he is instructed in the ways of the Force by the legendary Jedi Master Yoda. Meanwhile, Han Solo and Princess Leia make their way to planet Bespin, where they are greeted by Han\'s old friend, a shifty gambler named Lando Calrissian. Ambushed by the Empire shortly after their arrival, Han and his friends are imprisoned by Darth Vader. Luke leaves Dagobah to rescue his friends, and is met by Vader and a startling revelation.\r\n-\r\nLogic\r\n\r\nIn this movie, the battle to save the galaxy from the evil Darth Vader rages on. Han Solo, Princess Leia, and Chewbacca are tested in a devastating attack by the Imperial army and its AT-AT walkers. Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker seeks out the ancient Yoda to learn the secrets of the Jedi, secrets Luke will need when the Dark Side of the Force beckons him in a destiny-defining duel with Darth Vader.\r\n-\r\nRobert Lynch\r\n\r\nThe story of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, and the others did not end with the destruction of the Death Star, it continues in this movie. Imperial forces have since driven the Rebels to hide on the ice world of Hoth. But even on such an icy, backwater world, they cannot escape the evil Darth Vader\'s eyes for long, and he devastates the Rebel base in an assault with the Imperial AT-AT walkers. Luke flees to Dagobah to begin Jedi training with Master Yoda, while Han Solo, Chewbacca, Princess Leia, and C-3PO run the blockade of Imperial Star Destroyers in the Millennium Falcon. The Imperials pursue them across the galaxy and eventually catch up with them on Bespin. Now Darth Vader plans to use them as bait to lure Luke Skywalker to him, and turns Han Solo over to Boba Fett as a prize to be delivered to crime lord Jabba the Hutt. Luke learns a terrible family secret after losing a swordfight with the Dark Lord. Will he, and the others, escape the Empire\'s clutches?\r\n-\r\nmedic249a2', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-06-23', '', '2020-05-14 05:03:54', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::NRC\r\nBrazil::Livre\r\nCanada::PG\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::I\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::U\r\nIreland::G\r\nItaly::T\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::AA\r\nNetherlands::AL\r\nNew Zealand::PG\r\nNorway::12\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::0+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Africa::PG\r\nSouth Korea::All\r\nSpain::T\r\nSweden::11\r\nUnited Kingdom::U\r\nUnited States::PG\r\nUkraine::ZA\r\nWest Germany::12', 0),

Meanwhile, Luke struggles to help Darth Vader back from the dark side without falling into the Emperor\'s trap.\r\n-\r\nTom Benton & Travis Brainerd\r\n\r\nLuke Skywalker battles Jabba the Hutt and Darth Vader to save his comrades in the Rebel Alliance and triumph over the Galactic Empire. Han Solo and Princess Leia reaffirm their love, and team with Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, the Ewoks, and droids C-3PO and R2-D2 to aid in the disruption of the Dark Side, and the defeat of the evil emperor.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nEmperor Palpatine, Darth Vader, and the Empire are building a new Death Star. Meanwhile, Han Solo has been imprisoned, and Luke Skywalker has sent R2-D2 and C-3PO to try and free him. Princess Leia, disguised as a bounty hunter, and Chewbacca go along as well. The final battle takes place on the Forest Moon of Endor, with its natural inhabitants, the Ewoks, lending a hand to the rebels.\r\n-\r\nColin Tinto\r\n\r\nAs the evil Emperor Palpatine oversees the construction of the new Death Star by Darth Vader and the Galactic Empire, smuggler Han Solo is rescued from the clutches of the vile gangster Jabba the Hutt by his friends, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Lando Calrissian, and Chewbacca. Leaving Luke Skywalker Jedi training with Master Yoda, Solo returns to the Rebel fleet to prepare to complete his battle with the Empire. During the ensuing fighting, the newly returned Luke Skywalker is captured by Darth Vader.\r\n-\r\nJames Pearce\r\n\r\nLight-sabers sparkle, the Millennium Falcon flashes through hyperspace, and creatures from all over the galaxy defy the Galactic Empire, in this stunning third chapter of the \"Star Wars\" saga. As the Rebels prepare to attack Emperor Palpatine\'s awesome new Death Star, Han Solo remains imprisoned by the loathsome outlaw Jabba the Hutt, who has also captured Princess Leia. Luke Skywalker rescues his friends, but he will not be a true Jedi Knight until he confronts Darth Vader again, who has sworn to win him over to the Dark Side of the Force. With old favorites like Chewbacca, Yoda, R2-D2, C-3PO, and Lando Calrissian, plus the small, but stalwart Ewoks.\r\n-\r\nRobert Lynch\r\n\r\nThe Empire is more than halfway through construction of a new Death Star, almost twice as big, but more than twice as powerful. When completed, it will spell certain doom for Luke Skywalker and the rebels. Han Solo is a prisoner of crime lord Jabba the Hutt, and Princess Leia soon finds herself in the gangster\'s hands. Luke Skywalker, aided by C-3PO and R2-D2, makes his way into Jabba\'s palace, hoping to secure his friends\' freedom. But Jabba has no intention of doing so, and tries to kill them all. After escaping from Jabba and the sands of Tatooine, they regroup with the rebel fleet, which is massing for an attack against the new satellite battle station at Endor. Lando Calrissian is pressed into action to lead the rebel fighter attack, while Han is put in charge of a group of soldiers to take out the shield generator protecting the Death Star. However, Luke Skywalker surrenders to Darth Vader\'s soldiers on Endor, and is taken in front of Vader\'s Master, Emperor Palpatine, on the Death Star for final corruption to the Dark Side of the Force. The fleet of Imperial Star Destroyers ambushes the rebels, cutting them off. Worse, the new Death Star begins turning its giant laser on the rebel carriers. It appears that nothing will stop the Empire\'s triumph, unless things start to change quickly.\r\n-\r\nmedic249a2', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-06-23', '', '2020-05-14 05:05:25', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::NRC\r\nBrazil::Livre\r\nCanada::PG\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::I\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::U\r\nIreland::G\r\nItaly::T\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::A\r\nNetherlands::AL\r\nNew Zealand::PG\r\nNorway::12\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::0+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Africa::PG\r\nSouth Korea::All\r\nSpain::T\r\nSweden::11\r\nUnited Kingdom::U\r\nUnited States::PG\r\nUkraine::ZA\r\nWest Germany::12', 0);

Just let it in.\r\n\r\nA long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...', 'As a new threat to the galaxy rises, Rey, a desert scavenger, and Finn, an ex-stormtrooper, must join Han Solo and Chewbacca to search for the one hope of restoring peace.', 'As a new threat to the galaxy rises, Rey, a desert scavenger, and Finn, an ex-stormtrooper, must join Han Solo and Chewbacca to search for the one hope of restoring peace.\r\n\r\n30 years after the defeat of Darth Vader and the Empire, Rey, a scavenger from the planet Jakku, finds a BB-8 droid that knows the whereabouts of the long lost Luke Skywalker. Rey, as well as a rogue stormtrooper and two smugglers, are thrown into the middle of a battle between the Resistance and the daunting legions of the First Order.\r\n-\r\nNoah White\r\n\r\nA scavenger (Daisy Ridley) and a renegade stormtrooper (John Boyega) enlist the help of legendary smugglers/freedom fighters Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca to transport a droid carrying information regarding the whereabouts of long lost Jedi Master Luke Skywalker to General Leia Organa of the Resistance before it falls into the hands of Kylo Ren and the First Order.\r\n\r\nWhen critical information is placed into a simple droid, both the evil First Order and the heroic Resistance go searching for it. Then something neither of them planned for happens: Rey, a scavenger from the planet Jakku finds the droid and keeps it as her own. Finn, an ex-stormtrooper who hopes to leave his past behind him, crosses paths with her and breaks the news of what exactly the importance of the droid is. Next thing either of them know is that they are on the run in order to withhold the droid from the First Order. They meet a pair of old buddies and after a few skirmishes between them and the determined First Order, the droid is brought to the Resistance base. There, multiple plans are hatched against the First Order while the secret information on the droid is slowly and surely working itself out...\r\n\r\n30 years ago the Empire was defeated and now a new threat, the First Order has risen from the ashes of the Empire. A scavenger called Rey has come into contact with a droid that contains a map to the legendary Luke Skywalker, who has vanished. Rey and a rogue stormtrooper called Finn find themselves in a monumental conflict between good and evil, that will see faces old and new.\r\n\r\nThirty years after the Galactic Empire vanquished, a new threat rises. The First Order attempt to rule the Galaxy and only a small bunch of heroes have the ability to stop them. Meanwhile, a female scavenger named Rey teams up with a rogue stormtroopter to return a droid to the resistance base containing a map to a legendary Jedi Master.\r\n\r\nThe Empire is no more. In its place, The First Order has risen from the ashes of Darth Vader\'s legacy and aims to consolidate its power across the galaxy. However, The First Order is trying to find Luke Skywalker, the last Jedi, and wipe him off the face of galaxy. In a desperate bid to bide time for Luke, The Resistance sends veteran X-Wing pilot Poe Dameron to find out Skywalker\'s location. In a race against time and tyranny, The First Order and The Resistance are trying to find the galaxy\'s greatest Jedi before it\'s too late. The fate of the universe hangs in the balance.\r\n-\r\nJohnny', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-06-23', '', '2020-05-14 05:06:13', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::10\r\nIndia::U\r\nIndonesia::13+\r\nIreland::12\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMalta::PG\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::12\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Africa::10-12\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::7\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTaiwan::GP\r\nThailand::G\r\nTurkey::13A\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUkraine::12\r\nVietnam::C13', 0),

Never one to give up hope, Ella\'s fortunes begin to change after meeting a dashing stranger.\r\n\r\nA girl named Ella (Cinderella) has the purest heart living in a cruel world filled with evil stepsisters and an evil stepmother out to ruin Ella\'s life. Ella becomes one with her pure heart when she meets the Prince and dances her way to a better life with glass shoes, and a little help from her fairy godmother, of course.\r\n\r\nA live-action retelling of the classic fairytale about a servant stepdaughter who is abused by her jealous stepmother and stepsisters after her father died. Forced to be a servant in her own house, through it all she did not let anything or anyone crush her spirit. Then one day, she meets a dashing stranger in the woods.\r\n-\r\ngmorato\r\n\r\nElla (Eloise Webb) lives with her wealthy parents in a beautiful estate in a peaceful kingdom. From a young age, she is taught by her mother (Hayley Atwell) to believe in the existence and presence of magic, allowing her to befriend the many animals on the estate, particularly the mice. Everything is perfect until her mother contracts a fatal illness. On her deathbed, she makes Ella promise that she\'ll always have courage and show kindness to others. Years later, Ella\'s (Lily James\') father (Ben Chaplin) reveals that an old acquaintance, Lord Tremaine, has passed away and that he has chosen Tremaine\'s widow (Cate Blanchett), who has two daughters of her own, Drizella (Sophie McShera) and Anastasia (Holliday Grainger), as his second wife. Ella welcomes her stepfamily warmly, despite the stepsisters\' less than pleasant attitudes and her needing to protect her friends from her stepmother\'s cat, Lucifer. Soon after, Ella\'s father goes abroad on business. Sadly, he becomes ill and also dies. This new loss results in Lady Tremaine revealing her true cold, wicked nature. Desperate for money, she dismisses the servants and forces Ella to do all the work. Even worse, she gives Ella\'s room to the stepsisters, forces her to sleep in the attic, and won\'t even let her eat with the family. One morning, after Ella, not wanting to sleep in the cold attic, sleeps by the fireplace, her soot covered face leads her stepsisters to mock and dub her as Cinderella, which Lady Tremaine (and even Ella herself) calls her. Crushed by their cruelty, Ella goes for a ride in the woods, where she encounters a hunting party. She meets one of the hunters (Richard Madden), who claims to be an apprentice named Kit who lives in the palace. Unknown to her, he\'s actually the only son of the land\'s dying king (Sir Derek Jacobi). Despite never learning her name, Kit (a nickname given to him by his father) is enchanted by Ella\'s charm, kindness, and unique outlook on life and becomes obsessed with her. Upon learning that he has little time left, the King insists that Kit find a bride at an upcoming ball. Despite the law saying that he must marry a princess, Kit can\'t get over the mystery girl and talks his father into letting every eligible maiden in the land attend. When the ball is announced, the Tremaine family is ecstatic at the prospect of marrying into royalty. However, when Lady Tremaine refuses to buy Ella a new dress, she fashions one herself from an old dress of her mother\'s with help from the mice. The night of the ball, Ella tries to join her stepfamily on the way out, but Lady Tremaine, claiming that her mere presence will disgrace them, leads her daughters in ripping up the dress before leaving without her. Ella runs into the garden in tears and encounters an old beggar woman, who reveals herself to be her Fairy Godmother (Helena Bonham Carter). She uses her magic to turn a pumpkin into a magnificent carriage, four mice into horses, two lizards into footmen, and a goose into a coachman, as well as turning Ella\'s dress into a gorgeous blue gown complete with glass shoes before sending her on her way with the warning that the spell only lasts until midnight. At the ball, Ella wins the coveted first dance with Kit, whose true identity she\'s pleasantly surprised to learn. This irritates the Grand Duke (Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd), who\'s secretly promised Kit to a Princess, a fact Lady Tremaine overhears. After dancing, Ella and Kit tour the palace and grounds together, slowly falling in love, but before he can learn her name, the clock strikes 11:59, forcing her to flee, dropping one of her glass shoes in the process. She manages to get away before the stroke of midnight and hides the other shoe in her room as a memento. Soon after, the King dies, but not before giving his son permission to find his love. Once it\'s announced that every maiden in the kingdom is to try on the shoe, Ella goes to her room for hers, only to find Lady Tremaine waiting with it in hand, having figured out her identity from her attitude after the ball. Lady Tremaine demands that Ella make her head of the royal family and give her daughters proper husbands when she becomes queen and when she refuses, Lady Tremaine smashes the shoe and locks Ella in her room. She then brings the shoe and identity of the mystery girl to the Grand Duke and talks him into rewarding her with title of countess and worthy husbands for her daughters. He takes the shattered shoe to Kit, hoping to convince him to forget the mystery girl, but this makes him more determined than ever to find his love. The Grand Duke and the Captain of the guards (Nonso Anozie) lead a garrison to try the remaining shoe on all the maidens in the land, all of whom are rejected by its magic, before arriving at the Tremaine estate. When the shoe rejects both stepsisters, they turn to leave, only to hear Ella singing thanks to the mice opening her bedroom window. The Grand Duke tries to leave anyway but is stopped by one of the men, who reveals himself to be Kit in disguise and demands that the Captain investigate the sound. Once Ella is found, Lady Tremaine tries to forbid her from trying on the shoe, but is overruled by the Captain. Sure enough, the shoe fits and Ella leaves with Kit after forgiving her stepmother, who later is forced to leave the kingdom with her daughters and the Grand Duke, never to return. Kit and Ella are married and crowned king and queen. The Fairy Godmother narrates that they become the land\'s most beloved monarchs, ruling with the courage and kindness she promised her mother.\r\n-\r\nSpencer Higham\r\n\r\nElla is a down-to-earth, innocent young girl with a threatening stepmother and stepsisters.

During 70 years of utter secrecy, the Nazis construct a gigantic space fortress with a massive armada of flying saucers. When American astronaut James Washington puts down his Lunar Lander a bit too close to the secret Nazi base, the Moon FÃ¼hrer decides the glorious moment of retaking the Earth has arrived sooner than expected. Washington claims the mission is just a publicity stunt for the President of the United States, but what else could the man be but a scout for the imminent attack by Earth forces? The Fourth Reich must act. Two Nazi officers, ruthless Klaus Adler and idealistic Renate Richter, travel to Earth to prepare the invasion. In the end when the Moon Nazi UFO armada darkens the skies, ready to strike at the unprepared Earth, every man, woman and nation alike, must re-evaluate their priorities.\r\n-\r\nJarmo Puskala\r\n\r\nIn the waning days of WWII, the Nazis of the nearly destroyed Third Reich flee to the far side of the Moon, in 1945.

Now, hell-bent on returning to power, the super-race of Moon-Nazis seize the opportunity to invade the Earth with their formidable flotilla of spaceships and a mighty secret weapon.

However, in humankind\'s unlikely last refuge--the ruined swastika lunar base--overpopulation, famine, and limited food resources put in jeopardy the survival of both races, until the feisty daughter of James Washington and Renate Richter, Obi, decides to give humanity a fighting chance. Now, equipped with an indecipherable ancient map, Obi and a motley crew of earthlings embark on a dangerous mission to the centre of the fabled Hollow Earth, to find a source of unlimited power; nevertheless, the Vril, an alien shape-shifting race of reptilians, want it all for themselves.

He also happens to be suffering from a strange condition similar to schizophrenia which he futilely tries to keep under control by regularly taking both legal and illegal drugs and visiting his therapist. When a strange feisty young woman named Darlene and a secretive middle-aged man calling himself Mr. Robot, who claims to be the mysterious leader of an underground hacking group known as F-Society, offer Elliot a chance to take his vigilantism to the next level and help them take down E-Corp, the corrupt multi-national financial company that Elliot works for and likes to call Evil Corp, Elliot finds himself at the crossroads. Mr. Robot, who has personal reasons for wanting to take down E-Corp, also reveals that he already has one ally, an even more mysterious, secretive and highly dangerous shadowy hacking group known only as Dark Army. Meanwhile, Elliot\'s childhood and only friend, Angela, who blames E-Corp for the death of their parents, tries to take down E-Corp legally by joining their ranks and trying to dig up evidence of their corruption from the inside. A wild card in this scheme becomes Tyrell Wellick, an unhinged psychopathic E-Corp yuppie, originally from Scandinavia, who has a very unusual relationship with his dominant and ambitious wife Joanna. After many twists and turns, Mr. Robot\'s plan is finally put in motion - with catastrophic (un)intended results. But that\'s just the end of the beginning of the real story.\r\n\r\nMr. Robot follows Elliot, a young programmer who works as a cyber-security engineer by day and as a vigilante hacker by night. Elliot finds himself at a crossroads when the mysterious leader of an underground hacker group recruits him to destroy the firm he is paid to protect. Compelled by his personal beliefs, Elliot struggles to resist the chance to take down the multinational CEOs he believes are running (and ruining) the world. Eventually, he realizes that a global conspiracy does exist, but not the one he expected.\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan\r\n\r\nYoung, anti-social computer programmer Elliot works as a cybersecurity engineer during the day, but at night he is a vigilante hacker. He is recruited by the mysterious leader of an underground group of hackers to join their organization. Elliot\'s task? Help bring down corporate America, including the company he is paid to protect, which presents him with a moral dilemma. Although he works for a corporation, his personal beliefs make it hard to resist the urge to take down the heads of multinational companies that he believes are running -- and ruining -- the world.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nIn the year 2015, an incredibly unstable cyber-security engineer named Elliot is recruited by a shady group of hackers to bring down the most powerful corporation in the history of civilization; meanwhile, a dark project whose purpose could bring about profound implications for society itself nears its completion.\r\n-\r\nchingeeflingee', 'Blu-ray', 1, 0, '', 0, '2020-06-23', '', '2020-05-23 17:15:20', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 4, 0, 'Australia::M\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::16\r\nIndia::16+\r\nIreland::15\r\nItaly::BA\r\nJapan::R15+\r\nMexico::C\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPoland::16\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nUnited Kingdom::18\r\nUnited States::TV-MA', 13),

Exhibiting the same symptoms like one of his former patients, Cole goes one step further by solemnly claiming he has the gift, or curse, of a rare and unwelcome sixth sense; the mysterious ability to see the dreadful and unquiet spectres of the deceased who linger in this earth. However, can a slowly-recovering sceptic believe, let alone, heal, a desperate soul crying for help? And, what if Cole\'s disturbingly recurring apparitions are not figments of an injured fantasy, but an irrefutable reality?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nChild psychologist Malcom Crowe (Bruce Willis)is one night visited by an ex-patient named Vincent Grey (Donnie Wahlberg) who is not just angry, but enraged. He wounds Crowe, then kills himself. A few months later Crowe is visited by a 9-year old boy named Cole (Haley Joel Osment). He sees dead people who do not know they are dead. Because of this, he is called a freak in school. Crowe, at first thinks he is seeing things, but after spending a lot of time with Cole (much to his wife\'s (Olivia Williams) dismay), he discovers Cole may be seeing dead people after all.\r\n-\r\nBruce Willis\r\n\r\nChild psychiatrist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is confronted one night by his former patient Vincent Gray (Donnie Wahlberg) who he failed to help. After Vincent shoots Crowe in the stomach and kills himself, Crowe can\'t stop thinking about it. A few months later he is hired to help a troubled boy named Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), who has many of the same problems Vincent had.

Over the objections of her designer Dr. Ouelet, Hanka Robotics CEO Cutter decides to use Killian as a counter-terrorism operative.

He\'s good at his job and is constantly in the air flying from one city to another. He\'s also an accumulator of frequent flyer miles and has a goal: he wants to get to ten million miles. His routine is interrupted by the arrival of Natalie Keener, who thinks the travel is unnecessary and the firings can be done through videoconferencing. Ryan\'s boss loves the idea, but wants Ryan to take Natalie on the road with him to show her how he does it. It proves to be a life lesson for Natalie after one of her counseling sessions goes wrong. Ryan also learns that some of the choices he\'s made have not always been the correct one.\r\n-\r\ngarykmcd\r\n\r\nRyan Bingham\'s job is to fire people from theirs. The anguish, hostility, and despair of his \"clients\" has left him falsely compassionate, living out of a suitcase, and loving every second of it. When his boss hires arrogant young Natalie, she develops a method of video conferencing that will allow termination without ever leaving the office, essentially threatening the existence Ryan so cherishes. Determined to show the naive girl the error of her logic, Ryan takes her on one of his cross country firing expeditions, but as she starts to realize the disheartening realities of her profession, he begins to see the downfalls to his way of life.\r\n-\r\nThe Massie Twins\r\n\r\nRyan Bingham works for Omaha-based Career Transition Counseling, whose contracts are in corporate downsizing. In other words, they fire people. Ryan is flying around the U.S. over three hundred twenty days of the year, which he feels is the best part of his job. He does whatever he can to rack up frequent flyer miles, the goal not to use them, but just to accumulate them to a specific number he has in his mind. A secondary job he has is to give motivational speeches on relieving one\'s life of excess physical and emotional baggage. He truly does believe what he espouses as he lives out of his carry-on suitcase (his apartment in Omaha is really in name only), he is not close to his siblings (although he does do a favor for his sister while on his travels), nor does he have or want a significant person in his life. Ryan\'s life may change when the company hires Natalie Keener, a young overachieving woman who recommends that the company change the nature of the work by conducting the \"firings\" via remote computer access. Ryan believes that Natalie does not fully understand the nature of the business, and as such, their boss, Craig Gregory, suggests that she accompany Ryan on a business trip. Ryan is also trying to protect his way of life, which now includes meeting up with a woman named Alex Goran whenever their flight schedules mesh. Like Ryan, Alex, who he met in an airport hotel bar, is constantly travelling for work, and is as equally turned on the by the concepts of \"elite status\" or \"preferred member\" as Ryan is.\r\n-\r\nHuggo', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-06-23', '', '2020-06-08 07:29:04', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::G\r\nFinland::K-3\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::0\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::AL\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::A\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::NC-16\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::7\r\nSweden::Btl\r\nSwitzerland::7\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R', 13);

This project is beyond their day jobs. The project truly does belong to Aaron and Abe, as they use all their free time working on it, primarily trying to overcome the many engineering related problems they\'ve encountered. It is during one of his tests with the invention running that Abe discovers that a protein inside the main unit has multiplied much more rapidly than it could in nature. Rather than the invention being a protein super incubator, Abe, using himself as a guinea pig, and a very meticulous one at that, discovers that the invention can be used as a time machine. In his self experiment, Abe was especially careful not to interfere with his own self in that time warp. Abe passes along this discovery to Aaron, who he expects will tell his wife Kara in what is the sanctity of their marriage, but he doesn\'t want to tell either Robert or Phillip. Much to Abe\'s surprise, Aaron does not want to tell Kara, it being a sole intellectual property of just the two of them, in the process moving the base of operation to a locked storage unit. Aaron\'s plan for the two of them is to use the invention to win big in the stock market by knowing through the time travel what has happened in the market.

He is being raised by his single mother MarÃ­a. On the same night, a 72-hour electric storm breaks out, and Nico looking through his room window witnesses a violent scene in the house of his neighbour, Ãngel Prieto. He ventures into the house and stumbles on Hilda Weiss, Prieto\'s wife, lying dead in the house. Running scared from Prieto, who has discovered him in his home, Nico is run over by a passing car and dies as a result. Twenty-five years later, on November 9th, 2014, Vera Roy is a woman who divides her time between working as nurse in the hospital and her family: her husband David Ortiz and her little daughter Gloria. To celebrate moving into their new house in the suburbs, they invite her friend and former boyfriend Aitor Medina and his mother Clara to their house where Vera learns that she and David are living in Nico\'s house and that after his death, Ãngel Prieto was arrested and committed suicide in prison three months later. That night after dinner, Vera comes across the old analog TV set and camera equipment used by Nico the same night that the 72-hours storm broke out. After turning the TV on, the storm connects the two devices together as one, and Vera talks to Nico and warns him off his impending death. But after the conversation, Vera wakes up in the hospital in a parallel timeline: puzzled and confused, Vera realizes that she\'s not a nurse but a doctor spending a few days on sick leave after the death of a patient; her daughter Gloria no longer exists; David is married to his former girlfriend, Ãrsula; Aitor Medina never was her boyfriend; and Prieto is still alive and happily married to Clara Medina. With her memories constantly crossing both timelines each time that Vera touches someone, she meets Inspector Leyra in an attempt to prove the credibility of her story. Reluctant to believe her, Leyra agrees to investigate with her and both embark on a search for clues and evidence that can help to uncover the truth. With time running out and a few hours left before the storm blows itself out. In the belief that the key to this time riddle is finding out Nico Lasarte\'s whereabouts and proving the murder of Hilda Weiss, Vera tries not only to recover Gloria, but also to arrest Prieto and talk to the child Nico again. Which one of her two parallel lives is real? Is it her previous life a delusion? Will Vera be able to find a way to fix the things before the storm subsides?\r\n-\r\nChockys', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-06-23', '', '2020-06-13 12:57:13', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Brazil::16\r\nFrance::16\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::NC16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::12\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::TV-MA', 16),

This is his fourth year on the story, and he makes no effort to hide his frustration. On awaking the \'following\' day he discovers that it\'s Groundhog Day again, and again, and again.

The only noticeable upside is his attractive and good-natured producer. But the real nightmare begins when Phil ends up reliving the same day (Groundhog Day) over, and over again. Unable to leave the town due to a severe blizzard, and with no end in sight, Phil struggles to find a way to escape (and ultimately make the best of) his seemingly hopeless situation.\r\n-\r\nS. Lagan\r\n\r\nTV weatherman Phil Connors is cynical, to say the least, and having to go yet again to Punxsutawney, Pa. on February 2 to see if Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow isn\'t his idea of fun. He\'s grumpy with his segment producer Rita and downright nasty with cameraman Larry. He doesn\'t take the shadow business at all seriously but the next morning, awakens to find he is reliving the same day. Initially disbelieving and fighting what is happening to him, Phil eventually accepts that he will re-live the same day over and over again. He uses the opportunity to acquire new skills - piano playing and ice carving among them - and soon becomes the most admired man in Punxsutawney. Just how many times he relives the day, however, is anyone\'s guess.\r\n-\r\ngarykmcd\r\n\r\nIf forced to repeat the same day over and over again, how would you spend it? A sarcastic, egotistical weathman is forced to spend his least favorite assignment in small town Pa on Groundhog Day.....over and over again! He evolves and learns the key to life isn\'t what happens but how you react to it.\r\n\r\nPhil Connors is the arrogant and egotistical weatherman for local station WPBH-TV Pittsburgh. He has disdain for those with whom he works as well as for his viewers. But he has the most disdain for Groundhog Day held in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, which he is to cover for the fourth time in his career, this year with Rita and Larry, the station\'s new producer and cameraman respectively. Phil wants to get in and out of Punxsutawney as quickly as possible, but a snowstorm forces the threesome to stay an extra night in town after the Groundhog Day festivities. When Phil awakens the next morning, he is experiencing what he thinks is dÃ©jÃ  vu. In reality, he is experiencing that Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney all over again. The same happens the following day and the following. As Phil relives that same Groundhog Day over and over again, he goes through a myriad of highs and lows. But as he comes to the realization that Groundhog Day may be his fate for eternity, he also comes to other realizations, such as that his actions have no long term consequences, but that knowledge, especially as it relates to Rita, can be a powerful and dangerous thing. But he is given opportunity after opportunity to get the day \"right\".\r\n-\r\nHuggo', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '2020-06-23', '', '2020-06-16 14:37:47', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::PG\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE\r\nDenmark::7\r\nFinland::K-10\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::6\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::L\r\nIndia::U\r\nIreland::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nNetherlands::6\r\nNew Zealand::PG\r\nNorway::10\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::T\r\nSweden::7\r\nUnited Kingdom::PG\r\nUnited States::PG', 0),

As her squad starts to get smaller and smaller, will she make it to the Capitol? Will she get revenge on Snow or will her target change?

While her mission is to bring President Snow down once and for all, Katniss finds that her squad dies at the hands of either Mutts, Peacekeepers or both.

Recognition, for one, and she finds herself saddled with a team of expert warriors (which surprisingly includes the ailing Peeta) aimed to penetrate the Capitol that has barricaded itself behind Hunger-Game-style death traps. As she closes in on carrying out her private agenda through more deaths and mayhem, President Snow himself makes her aware of another threat to peace for Panem equal to himself, leaving her to consider how to truly end the bloodshed.\r\n-\r\nstatmanjeff', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '0000-00-00', '', '2020-06-24 04:35:37', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::14\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::12\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMalta::12A\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::12\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::10-12\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nThailand::15\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nVietnam::C16', 13);

Harry will be in touch with further instructions. While they wait for Harry\'s call, Ken, following Harry\'s advice, takes in the sights of the medieval city with great appreciation. But the charms of Bruges are lost on the simpler Ray, who is already despondent over the innocent death, especially as it was his first job. Things change for Ray when he meets Chloe, part of a film crew shooting a movie starring an American dwarf named Jimmy. When Harry\'s instructions arrive, Ken, for whom the job is directed, isn\'t sure if he can carry out the new job, especially as he has gained a new appreciation of life from his stay in the fairytale Bruges. While Ken waits for the inevitable arrival into Bruges of an angry Harry, who feels he must clean up matters on his own, Ray is dealing with his own problems, not only with Harry, but with a Canadian couple and a half-blind thief named Eirik.

Ray\'s disposition changes when he meets ChloÃ«, a hip young woman who sells drugs on the local set of a movie featuring Jimmy, an American dwarf. Harry calls with irrevocable instructions.

His daughter is stealing from him to save up for a nose job, his pot-head son, who gets stoned at his own bar-mitzvah, only wants him round to fix the TV aerial and his useless brother Arthur is an unwelcome house guest. But both Arthur and Larry get turfed out into a motel when Larry\'s wife Judy, who wants a divorce, moves her lover, Sy, into the house and even after Sy\'s death in a car crash they are still there. With lawyers\' bills mounting for his divorce, Arthur\'s criminal court appearances and a land feud with a neighbour Larry is tempted to take the bribe offered by a student to give him an illegal exam pass mark.

Mild-mannered Larry Gopnik, living in suburban Minneapolis with his wife Judith and their two children, teenaged Sarah and preteen Danny, is a Physics professor at a local college. Larry lets life wash over him, especially as it has not placed any major bumps yet along the way, with a few upcoming perks being that he is on a tenure track, the decision to be made soon, the deliberation by the tenure committee which he is assured is only a formality, and Danny will soon have his bar mitzvah. Minor bumps include Sarah and Danny constantly being at each other\'s throats, especially about money, all three of his family members treating him more as a fixture than a husband or father, and his unemployed mathematician brother Arthur living with them in their already crowded house, he sleeping on their sofa. What Larry does not know about his life is that Danny is more interested in listening to Jefferson Airplane and smoking weed than he is in his Hebrew studies for the bar mitzvah. Larry believes that his Jewish faith will keep him safe. However, things slowly start to fall off the rails for Larry. Judith asks for a divorce in falling in love with a mutual friend, effete widower Sy Ableman. Judith, in the process, wants proverbially everything in the settlement, leaving Larry in a financial bind. Larry is having problems with a South Korean exchange student named Clive, who may or may not be bribing him for a passing grade, which becomes more clear as time goes on. Although he is further assured that they are not an issue, he learns that someone is sending poison pen letters about him to the tenure committee, most probably Clive in what seems to be his campaign to get a good grade or else. Their neighbor, Brandt, is slowly encroaching on their property. Someone has signed him up with the Columbia House record club, they who are hounding him for payment for records he has never received. And Arthur get into some problems with the law. One distraction are his new neighbors, the Samskys, voluptuous Mrs. Samsky who has a penchant for sunbathing nude in their back yard. In the process, Larry looks for some answers to all these problems, especially from his faith. He wants to speak most specifically to Rabbi Marshak, the senior rabbi at his synagogue who is now more a figurehead than practicing rabbi. As such, even trying to see Rabbi Marshak, let alone speak to him, is more difficult than just wanting it to happen.\r\n-\r\nJefferson Airplane', 'Blu-ray', 1, 0, '', 0, '0000-00-00', '', '2020-06-24 06:54:10', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::G\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-11\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nIceland::12\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R', 13),

Keller Dover is facing every parent\'s worst nightmare. His six-year-old daughter, Anna, is missing, together with her young friend, Joy, and as minutes turn to hours, panic sets in. The only lead is a dilapidated RV that had earlier been parked on their street. Heading the investigation, Detective Loki arrests its driver, Alex Jones, but a lack of evidence forces his release. As the police pursue multiple leads and pressure mounts, knowing his child\'s life is at stake the frantic Dover decides he has no choice but to take matters into his own hands. But just how far will this desperate father go to protect his family?\r\n-\r\nWarner Bros. Pictures\r\n\r\nWhen two girls go missing, the families call the police. The brother of one of the girls says that an RV was parked on the street. The police find the RV and the man inside is a mentally challenged man. The detective in charge questions him but says nothing. The father of one of the girls tells the detective to keep him locked up so they can work on him. But he says without more evidence they have to let him go. When the father learns of this he goes to confront the man and the man says something which makes the father think he knows something. So he grabs him and works on him to make him talk but he doesn\'t. The detective continues to try and find the girls.\r\n-\r\nrcs0411@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nOn Thanksgiving, Keller Dover, his wife Grace, their teenage son Ralph and their little daughter Anna go to the home of their neighbors and friends Franklin Birch, his wife Nancy, their teenage daughter Eliza and their little daughter Joy to celebrate together in a lunch party. Anna and Joy want to play on the street and Ralph stays with them. The girls play in a ROV and Ralph brings them back home. Later Anna asks her father to go to their house with Joy to seek her emergency whistle and Keller tells her to call Ralph or Eliza to go with them. Later the families realize that the girls went alone and have vanished, and they call the police department. Detective Loki is assigned to the case and he arrests the teenager Alex Jones that drives the trailer. Soon they learn that Alex has the IQ of a ten year-old boy and he is discharged. When he is leaving the precinct with his aunt Holly Jones, Keller presses Alex and he says to Keller that \"the girls have not cried when he left them\". Keller asks to keep Alex imprisoned during the investigations, but Loki cannot hold him anymore. While Detective Loki investigates the pedophiles near the location, Keller decides to abduct Alex to torture him and find where his beloved daughter and her friend are, crossing the thin line between right and wrong.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nIn a town in northeastern Pennsylvania, Keller and Grace Dover, Franklin and Nancy Birch, and their respective offspring - each couple with a teenager and adolescent apiece - are best friends. While the two families are celebrating Thanksgiving together, the two adolescent girls, Anna Dover and Joy Birch, go missing. Based on events earlier in the day, the two families believe that the girls were abducted by whoever lives in the camper van parked in their neighborhood. Their beliefs are strengthened after they meet the resident of the camper, Alex Jones, a mentally childlike young man who is supported in every respect by his overprotective aunt, Holly Jones, and based on other subsequent evidence about Alex that emerges. However, Detective Loki, the lead police investigator, is pretty certain that Alex did not abduct the girls, he instead initially following leads of known sex offenders and pedophiles in the area. In addition, Loki has no evidence to hold Alex in custody, placing him at odds especially with Keller, who is certain that Alex is the one who abducted the girls. While Loki continues his investigation with Keller accusing him of not doing his job by following what he considers are pointless leads, Keller decides he has to take matters into his own hands. He has to decide how much he will involve Grace, Franklin and Nancy in getting Alex to divulge where the girls are by any means possible. His decisions as in who he will involve in getting Alex to talk may depend on how like-minded he believes the other three are, they who may be as devastated as he is, but who may neither be certain that Alex is the perpetrator or go to the same extremes as he to get the information from Alex.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nAgainst the backdrop of what should have been a happy Thanksgiving dinner, a terrible case of a mysterious abduction unfolds, as Anna, the six-year-old daughter of the small-town carpenter, Keller Dover, and her best friend, Joy, vanish without a trace. As time is against the desperate father, the only lead points at troubled Alex Jones; however, due to lack of evidence, Detective Loki knows that the alleged prime suspect will soon be free. Now, the odds are against them, and Keller will have to take matters into his own hands, even if his reckless decision threatens to put his freedom at risk. Will he ever see the girls again, alive and in one piece?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas', 'Blu-ray', 1, 0, '', 0, '0000-00-00', '', '2020-06-24 06:56:49', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIreland::15\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nLithuania::N-16\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nSingapore::NC-16\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nThailand::15\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::R', 16),

You may know him better as Saul Goodman, Walter White\'s slippery, resourceful lawyer in Breaking Bad. When first we meet him it is a few years before he meets Walter White. He is a struggling lawyer in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He mostly defends small-time crooks and represents people in civil liability claims. His brother, Charles \"Chuck\" McGill, is a senior partner at a prestigious Albuquerque law firm but hasn\'t left his house for several months due to a strange affliction. Jimmy is supporting him through bringing him groceries and the like. Jimmy has a dark, pre-lawyer past, being a small-time fraudster in Chicago before moving to Albuquerque to start over and work with at his brother\'s firm. We also meet Mike Ehrmantraut, ex-cop now working as a toll booth attendant at the courthouse parking lot. We see how Jimmy and Mike\'s stories converge and how Jimmy slowly becomes the Saul Goodman we know from Breaking Bad.\r\n-\r\ngrantss\r\n\r\nBefore he met Walter White, Saul Goodman was struggling working-class lawyer Jimmy McGill. How did McGill become Mr. Goodman and what led him to his life with the notorious \'Heisenberg\' in the first place? \'Better Call Saul\' is the origin story of a man trying to survive in a harsh, exploitative world where anyone and everyone will try and take him, and his dreams, down.\r\n-\r\nJohnny\r\n\r\nMeet James M. McGill Esq. Attorney-at-law AKA Slippin\' Jimmy AKA Saul Goodman. This features the life and emergence of Saul Goodman, the criminal attorney, as he is known in Breaking Bad.

Few dare to rebel against him. A young thief, whose love was taken captive by the god, seeks to dethrone and defeat Set with the aid of the powerful god Horus.\r\n-\r\nJames Pasier\r\n\r\nIn the ancient Egypt, the god Ra has split Egypt in two: the fertile part with the Nile would be ruled by his son Osiris and the desert by his son Set. During the coronation of Horus by his father Osiris, Set betrays his brother and kills him. Then he withdraws the eyes of Horus that are his source of power and exiles him in the desert. The mortal thief Bek and his beloved wife Zaya that worships Horus become slaves of Set. Zaya, who is working for Set\'s architect Urshu, convinces Bek to steal the eyes of Horus from a well-protected pyramid designed by Urshu to give them back to Horus, the only one capable to defeat Set. Bek succeeds but retrieves only one of the eyes; however Urshu discovers the theft and Bek and Zaya need to flee. Urshu kills Zaya with an arrow and when Bek reaches Horus\' shelter, he proposes to help the god to retrieve his other eye. In return, he demands that Horus bring his beloved Zaya back from the underworld. They team up and soon Horus\' lover Hathor, the goddess of love, leaves Set and joins them in their quest to defeat the evil Set.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nSet in the mythology of ancient Egypt, the world is flat and the Egyptian gods live among humans. The gods differ from humans by their greater height, golden blood, and ability to transform into their divine forms. A young thief named Bek and his love Zaya are attending the coronation of Horus. During the ceremony, Osiris is killed by his extremely jealous brother Set, who seizes the throne and declares a new regime where the dead will have to pay with riches to pass into the afterlife. Horus is stripped of his eyes, the source of his power, and almost killed. His love, Hathor pleads with Set to spare him and he is instead exiled in exchange for Egypt\'s surrender..\r\n\r\nIn an Age of physically ruling Pharaonic gods, Osiris assembles all Egypt\'s capital to witness transferring his happy reign of the Nile kingdom to his conceited son, Horus. However, during the ceremony Osiris\'s brother Seth, who was practically banished by their father sun Ra to rule the barren desert lands, marches in with an invincible magical army to seize the crown, wed love goddess Hathor, lock her blinded fiance Horus in his tomb, and install a reign of terror over Egypt, reduced to slavish drudgery and denying a happy afterlife to all but those who can buy themselves out of hell. Crafty knave thief Bek is madly in love with Zaya, the slave secretary of royal architect Urshu, but gets caught sneaking in the master\'s palace, enraging him enough to kill her during a chase in the capital. Bek vows to do the impossible: restore Zaya to life in exchange for the eye of Horus, the magical seat of his power, to overthrow Seth. The very deal is a false promise, they need to overcome magical obstacles and help from Hathor and Ra to prepare for a face-off with Seth.\r\n-\r\nKGF Vissers', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '0000-00-00', '', '2020-06-27 11:37:06', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::PG\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::13+\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMaldives::18+\r\nMalta::12A\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::9\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::10-12\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::7\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nThailand::15\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUkraine::12\r\nVietnam::C16', 12);

Beyond the fact that Samantha does not have a body, they have to come up with ways of making the relationship into one truly fulfilling in every component. Three of the many questions that may arise are whether Theodore\'s relationship with Samantha is preventing him from having a more satisfying relationship with a female human, whether a human and a computer operating system truly can be bonded in all critical aspects, and whether Samantha\'s quick evolution means she will evolve even further to her own form of self-fulfillment.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nIn a near future, lonely Theodore works writing beautiful handwritten letters in a company, and is divorcing from his wife Catherine. In his leisure time, he usually recalls the good moments of his life with Catherine and likes to play a new videogame. His best friend is his neighbor Amy, who is married to Charles. One day, Theodore sees the advertisement of a new operating system called OS-1 that is announced as the first artificially intelligent operating system and he decides to buy it. After the installation, he has a conversation with a seductive female voice and when he asks her name, she tells that she is Samantha. Soon Samantha develops her feelings and they fall in love with each other. The insecure Theodore feels divided for loving a computer system while Samantha does not stop to grow-up and evolve.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nSensitive letter writer Theodore has just ended his marriage. Lonely, he goes out to buy an artificially intelligent Operating System that promises to give him everything he needs. Samantha is more than his average OS. She does secretarial work for him but also becomes his friend whenever he\'s lonely. They go out on adventures and travel together. He becomes the physical feet to get them places, and she the new eyes in which to see the world. Their intimate moments soon turn into love and they start an unusual relationship between OS and human. Things get complicated as they deal with Theodore\'s complex emotions and Samantha\'s inability to provide physical comfort. What happens to an OS when its consciousness is altered? Or to a sensitive man who doubts his emotions?\r\n-\r\nMarielle\r\n\r\nTheodore Twombly (Phoenix) has built his career on expressing the emotions that others cannot. His job is to pen heartfelt, deeply personal letters to complete strangers based on details provided by the clients of the company he works for, and he has a knack for finding just the right words for every occasion. Meanwhile, reluctant to sign the papers that will finalize his divorce to his childhood sweetheart, depressed Theodore has slowly withdrawn from his supportive social circle, which includes his longtime friend Amy (Amy Adams), herself floundering in a failed marriage. When Theodore purchases a new state-of-the-art computer operating system with the ability to learn and grow with the user, he sits down at his desk and prepares to get his life in order. Adopting the name Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), the perceptive software slowly begins to bring Theodore out of his shell by encouraging him to start dating again, and joining him everywhere he goes. Very quickly, their relationship turns intimate, with Theodore teaching Samantha what it means to feel human and Samantha giving him the strength to walk away from his failed marriage. Things soon get complicated, however, when Samantha\'s rapidly evolving knowledge base begins to alter the very core of their relationship..', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '0000-00-00', '', '2020-07-06 10:57:28', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::14A\r\nChile::14\r\nColombia::15\r\nDenmark::7\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::A\r\nPhilippines::R-16\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::Btl\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTurkey::15+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUkraine::16', 18),

Now adults, the childhood friends have long since gone their separate ways. But when people start disappearing, Mike Hanlon calls the others home for one final stand. Damaged by scars from the past, the united Losers must conquer their deepest fears to destroy the shape-shifting Pennywise -- now more powerful than ever.\r\n\r\nDerry, Maine. A small town with a terrible curse. Every 27 years, an ancient being comes up from the sewer depths to feed off of the fear of children. Since it\'s defeat in 1989, Pennywise has grown hungry, and is now back with a vengeance. If the losers club doesn\'t defeat him this time, their worst fear will become a reality, with nothing to stop him. The clock is ticking. Who\'s going to be scared first?\r\n\r\nAfter the survivors\' irrevocable blood oath in It (2017)--and nearly three incident-free decades after the blood-soaked encounter with the demonic shape-shifter, Pennywise the Dancing Clown--the estranged members of the Losers\' Club find themselves before a dreadful obligation: to return to Derry and honour their promise. Once again, the brutal murder of an innocent awakens the grisly memories of the past, reuniting the old band of companions, as the nightmarish monster has come back from the shadows of oblivion to terrorise the small town, intent on revenge and slaughter.

He has no real friends and spends most of his time away from work by himself. Despite having an interest in the opposite sex philosophically as witnessed by his constant and uncontrollable morning erections, he is still a virgin. He never planned not to have sex, but it became more and more difficult to have that first experience as he got older, to the point where, to him, it became a reality for his life. When his work colleagues find out, some mock and ridicule him, while a small group comprised of Dave, Jay and Cal take it upon themselves to help him get laid, despite each of three having their own relationship issue making them perhaps not the best people to provide advice or assistance. Andy also gets some unexpected suggestions from some standing on the sidelines of his life. Beyond that advice, Andy has to be the one to take the ultimate step to reality, he not only having no practical experience, but also no theoretical experience in that he doesn\'t even watch or have interest in porn or masturbate. Some of the advice he receives centers on the actual woman who should be his first time. Regardless of that advice, he decides that the woman he truly wants is Trish, a specialty retailer with a somewhat useless bricks and mortar outlet across the street from the electronics store. As Andy pursues then eventually falls for Trish, he has to decide how much of his true self he will divulge to her.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\n40-year-old Andy Stitzer has done quite a few things in his life. He\'s got a cushy job stamping invoices at an electronics superstore, a nice apartment with a proud collection of action figures and comic books, good friends, a nice attitude. But there\'s just one little thing he hasn\'t quite gotten around to doing yet--something most people have done by his age. Done a lot. Andy\'s never, ever, ever had sex--not even by accident. So is that such a big deal? Well, for Andy\'s buds at the store, it sure is. Although they think he\'s a bit of an oddball, there\'s certainly a planet full of stranger (and homelier) guys who\'ve at least had one go at having a go. They consider it their duty to help Andy out of his dire situation and go to great lengths to help him. But nothing proves effective enough to lure their friend out of lifelong chastity until he meets Trish (Catherine Keener), a 40-year-old mother of three. Andy\'s friends are psyched by the possibility that \"it\" may finally happen...until they hear that Andy and Trish have begun their relationship based on a mutual no-sex policy.\r\n-\r\nAnonymous\r\n\r\nAndy Stitzer has a nice life complete with an action figure collection and a cushy job at an electronics store.

Debbie leaves the place but Allison stays with Ben, drinking and dancing along all night; completely wasted, they end up having a one night stand.

Their sole work - unpaid self-employment - is creating a website that identifies where scenes of women\'s nudity appears in mainstream movies. Alison Scott lives in a suite in the house of Debbie and Pete, her sister and brother-in-law. Slightly insecure Alison masks that insecurity by trying to control her life, much like her sister. Alison celebrates her promotion as on-air reporter for E! by going out with Debbie to a club, where she meets Ben. A generous gesture on Ben\'s part leads to Ben and Alison hooking up, which by the sober light of day she realizes was probably a mistake as they are totally incompatible. Conversely, Ben really likes Alison, who generally would be considered out of his league. However, that liaison results in Alison becoming pregnant. After thinking about the implications, she decides to keep the baby. Beyond the personal issues, Alison struggles with how this pregnancy will affect her new job, especially in the eyes of her image conscious bosses, Jack and Jill. Despite being a big kid himself, Ben, wanting to do right by Alison, supports her in any way he can. As they are both \"nice\" people who strive for the traditional when it comes to family, they decide to give their relationship a shot despite their incompatibility.

The film follows Zain as he journeys from gutsy, streetwise child to hardened 12-year-old \"adult\" fleeing his negligent parents, surviving through his wits on the streets, where he meets Ethiopian migrant worker Rahil, who provides him with shelter and food, as Zain takes care of her baby son Yonas in return. Zain later gets jailed for committing a violent crime, and finally seeks justice in a courtroom.\r\n\r\nWith his family grappling with extreme poverty, forever indebted to their ruthless landlord, the sad twelve-year-old boy, Zain, is forced to fend for himself in the squalid and overcrowded slums of Beirut. Unable to save his eleven-year-old sister, Sahar, from an uneasy arrangement, Zain will soon find himself all alone in a faceless city, ending up at a small amusement park to befriend another lost soul: the Ethiopian cleaner and mother of one, Rahil. But, in this grim and hostile world, there is no room for dreamers--and as a horrifying discovery is the last straw--a rabid desire for retribution possesses Zain and his blood-thirsty knife demands justice.

Years after his death, the living children of the parents responsible for Krueger\'s death (including Nancy Thompson, daughter of the police officer who arrested Krueger) experience terrifying nightmares involving a burned man wearing a glove with razor blades on the fingers. The ghost of Fred Krueger haunts their dreams, and when Nancy\'s best friend Tina dies violently in her sleep during a dream confrontation with Krueger, Nancy realizes she must find a way to stop the evil psychopath\'s reign of terror - or never sleep again.\r\n-\r\nDerek O\'Cain\r\n\r\nFred Kruger is the substance of nightmares. He always appears strangely dressed and has knives on the fingers of his right hand. A group of four teenagers all begin to have the same strange dreams about Fred before one of them is gruesomely murdered in her sleep. The survivors soon realize that if Fred kills them in their sleep, then they will die in real life too. Thus begins an ordeal of wakefulness as they try to find some way to stop Fred.\r\n-\r\nGoth\r\n\r\nNancy and her friends suffer violent nightmares which all feature one common element, a disfigured serial killer with a glove made of razors on his right hand.

Too good. And to stop the rest of his team looking bad, he is reassigned to the quiet town of Sandford. He is paired with Danny Butterman, who endlessly questions him on the action lifestyle. Everything seems quiet for Angel, until two actors are found decapitated. It is called an accident, but Angel isn\'t going to accept that, especially when more and more people turn up dead. Angel and Danny clash with everyone, whilst trying to uncover the truth behind the mystery of the apparent \"accidents\".\r\n-\r\nFilm_Fan\r\n\r\nInstead of appreciating his extraordinary arrest record, his faithful and impeccable service to the country, and his set of formidable skills, the superiors of the exemplary officer of the London Metropolitan Police, PC Nicholas Angel, \"promote\" him to the sleepy town of Sandford. There, like a fish out of water, Angel must get used to an entirely different reality, and for the first time in a long while, learn how to relax as the partner of the local police chief\'s overzealous son, Danny. However, against the backdrop of a rather uneventful service, a sudden spate of grisly accidents will jolt Nick into action, leading him to believe that there\'s more to the seemingly tranquil and picture-perfect community than meets the eye. Now, a sinister conspiracy threatens Sandford\'s peace. Will Danny finally get to see action after all?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nNicholas Angel is the finest cop London has to offer, with an arrest record 400% higher than any other officer on the force. He\'s so good, he makes everyone else look bad. As a result, Angel\'s superiors send him to a place where his talents won\'t be quite so embarrassing - the sleepy and seemingly crime-free village of Sandford. Once there, he is partnered with the well-meaning but overeager police officer Danny Butterman. The son of amiable Police Chief Frank Butterman, Danny is a huge action movie fan and believes his new big-city partner might just be a real-life \"bad boy,\" and his chance to experience the life of gunfights and car chases he so longs for. Angel is quick to dismiss this as childish fantasy and Danny\'s puppy-like enthusiasm only adds to Angel\'s growing frustration. However, as a series of grisly accidents rocks the village, Angel is convinced that Sandford is not what it seems and as the intrigue deepens, Danny\'s dreams of explosive, high-octane, car-chasing, gunfighting, all-out action seem more and more like a reality. It\'s time for these small-town cops to break out some big-city justice.\r\n-\r\nRogue Pictures\r\n\r\nSgt. Nicholas Angel is just about the perfect copper: honest, reliable, and dedicated to public duty. The only problem is that he is too good. His arrest record is so good that he is making everyone else look bad so he suddenly finds himself transferred to the picturesque village of Sandford. There he not only finds that the police force is less than ideal, but that there is in fact very little policing to do. The odd drunk and a few lads with a can of spray paint are about all there is to worry about. He becomes friendly with Constable Danny Butterman, who just happens to be the station chief\'s son. Suddenly however, there is a rash of murders that leads him to believe there is a massive conspiracy to keep the village clean and inoffensive.\r\n-\r\ngarykmcd', 'Blu-ray', 1, 0, '', 0, '0000-00-00', '', '2020-08-04 01:55:34', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-15\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-16\r\nIreland::15\r\nIsrael::16\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::R15+\r\nMalaysia::18PL\r\nMexico::C\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R13\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::R-16\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::NC-16\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTaiwan::R-18\r\nUnited Kingdom::18\r\nUnited States::R', 13),

More than thirty-six centuries later, in 1923, to be exact, adventurer Rick leads Egyptologist Evelyn and her brother Jonathan to mysterious Hamunaptra. While Jonathan is keen on finding the legendary Egyptian treasures, Evelyn wants to search for the Book of the Living, which would clarify a lot in historical knowledge about the ancient Egyptians. Unfortunately, they and a rivaling group of careless American adventurers free Imhotep\'s mummy from his eternal prison. Now, with the ancient and quite agile high priest on the loose, the adventurers and scientists face not only a dangerous enemy, but also a massive threat to today\'s world: Imhotep wants to bring Anck Su Namun back to life by using Evelyn\'s body, but he also wants to rid the world of the disbelieving crowd of democracy-supporters to be able to enforce his tyrannic dictatorship.\r\n-\r\nJulian Reischl', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '0000-00-00', '', '2020-08-15 05:27:59', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBelgium::KT/EA\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::14A\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::A\r\nItaly::T\r\nMexico::A\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::0+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::7\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUkraine::12', 18),

Living on this hidden island is a giant gorilla and this beast now has Ann is its grasps. Carl and Ann\'s new love, Jack Driscoll must travel through the jungle looking for Kong and Ann, whilst avoiding all sorts of creatures and beasts. But Carl has another plan in mind.\r\n-\r\nFilm_Fan\r\n\r\nAt the height of the Great Depression, the visionary but hard-pressed filmmaker, Carl Denham, talks the down-and-out New York City Vaudeville actress, Ann Darrow, into following him to Singapore for his upcoming movie extravaganza. Instead--aboard a weather-beaten tramp steamer, along with the respected playwright, Jack Driscoll--the unsuspecting crew find themselves at the back of beyond, in the impenetrable jungles of the obscure Skull Island: the home of ferocious primaeval relics, and the mysterious land of Kong, the all-powerful eight-metre-tall silverback gorilla. Now, as the monstrous ape holds captive the flaxen-haired protagonist, a handful of valiant but insignificant defenders must fight tooth and nail with formidable adversaries and the isle\'s mighty ruler, as the manipulative director captures unbelievable raw footage. Can anyone escape from the wrath of the savage King Kong?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nSet in the 1930s, this is the story of a group of explorers and documentary filmmakers who travel to the mysterious Skull Island (near Sumatra) to investigate legends of a giant gorilla named Kong. Once there, they discover that King Kong is a real creature, living in a massive jungle where creatures from prehistoric times have been protected and hidden for millions of years. As the explorers search for the great ape, their quest puts them up against both Kong and his dinosaur enemies. Ultimately, it is the attention of a beautiful human woman that soothes Kong long enough for him to be subdued by the explorers and shipped back to New York, where his bleak future involves being put on display in front of humans... but how long can even the mightiest shackles of man hold back an ape 25 feet tall?\r\n-\r\nbondish', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '0000-00-00', '', '2020-08-15 05:28:24', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::13+\r\nCzech Republic::12\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-11\r\nFrance::Tous publics avec avertissement\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::11\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13', 12),

Never one to run with the crowd, Bella never cared about fitting in with the trendy girls at her Phoenix, Arizona high school. When her mother remarries and Bella chooses to live with her father in the rainy little town of Forks, Washington, she doesn\'t expect much of anything to change. But things do change when she meets the mysterious and dazzlingly beautiful Edward Cullen. For Edward is nothing like any boy she\'s ever met. He\'s nothing like anyone she\'s ever met, period. He\'s intelligent and witty, and he seems to see straight into her soul. In no time at all, they are swept up in a passionate and decidedly unorthodox romance - unorthodox because Edward really isn\'t like the other boys. He can run faster than a mountain lion. He can stop a moving car with his bare hands. Oh, and he hasn\'t aged since 1918. Like all vampires, he\'s immortal. That\'s right - vampire. But he doesn\'t have fangs - that\'s just in the movies. And he doesn\'t drink human blood, though Edward and his family are unique among vampires in that lifestyle choice. To Edward, Bella is that thing he has waited 90 years for - a soul mate. But the closer they get, the more Edward must struggle to resist the primal pull of her scent, which could send him into an uncontrollable frenzy. Somehow or other, they will have to manage their unmanageable love. But when unexpected visitors come to town and realize that there is a human among them Edward must fight to save Bella? A modern, visual, and visceral Romeo and Juliet story of the ultimate forbidden love affair - between vampire and mortal.\r\n-\r\nSummit Entertainment\r\n\r\nWhen Bella moves to the rainy, cold and cloudy town of Forks to live with her dad, she doesn\'t expect much. She\'s kind of a misfit and doesn\'t have a lot of friends. But when she meets the extremely mysterious and handsome looking boy, Edward Cullen everything changes. As the two slowly grow closer, Bella stumbles upon Edward\'s most deadly secret and they begin to realize they have a very strong love for one another. Edward has been waiting for a long time for a soul mate and Bella is the one. But the closer he gets to her the more difficult it becomes for him to resist her blood. The two know they are entering a forbidden relationship and that they have to face many dangers just because they are together. Will Bella trust her heart or the warning signs going through her head?\r\n\r\nWithout expectations, the mature high school student, Bella Swan, relocates to the rain-soaked town of Forks to live with her father, after her divorced mother decides to remarry. However--as life is as exciting as it is unpredictable--the taciturn newcomer has a life-altering encounter with her withdrawn and morosely beautiful classmate, Edward Cullen, who, right from the start, senses the intoxicating effects of a dangerously suppressed feeling gnawing at him. Now--harbouring the deep and dark secret of vampiric immortality--Edward\'s insatiable thirst for warm blood stands in the way of experiencing a much nobler, and yet unfulfilled feeling. Little by little, as shocking revelations pave the way for an all-consuming whirlwind romance, innocent Bella\'s mortal flesh yearns for the palpable wonders of immortal love; even if her unquenched desire may lead her to her demise. Is this unconventional union nothing but a dream, or is this the prelude to an unending young passion?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nIsabella Swan moves to gloomy Forks to live with her father. As she starts her junior year in high school she becomes fascinated by Edward Cullen who holds a dark secret which is only known by his family. Edward falls in love with Bella as well but knows the further they progress in their relationship the more he is putting Bella and those close to her at risk. Edward warns Bella that she should leave him but she refuses to listen and to understand why he is saying this. Bella learns his secret. He is a vampire, however she is not afraid of his blood-thirsty needs and the fact he could kill her at any moment. Bella is afraid of losing him, the love of her life. The thrill begins when a new vampire finds it a challenge to hunt Bella down for her irresistible blood. The game is on and James will not stop until she is killed.\r\n-\r\ncourtney\r\n\r\nBella Swan was not expecting anything out of the ordinary to happen when she moved to live with her Dad in Forks, Washington. But this where her life truly begins. There she meets Edward Cullen, a mysterious and captivating student at her new high school. Bella soon discovers that Edward is hiding a secret, after he impossibly saves her life with his super-human strength and speed. She is determined to unravel his secret, but the truth is more terrifying than she realized. Edward is a vampire. Any normal person would just keep away from him, but Edward and Bella have fallen passionately and unconditionally in love with each other. And so begins their forbidden relationship between a human and a vampire. But the young lovers soon discover that their troubles are only just about to begin.\r\n-\r\nMel from the Untied Kingdom.', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '0000-00-00', '', '2020-08-19 16:10:06', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::PG\r\nCzech Republic::12\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-13\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::11\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13', 12),

Wells. Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) is a dockworker living in New Jersey, divorced from his first wife Mary Ann (Miranda Otto) and estranged from his two children Rachel and Robbie (Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin), of whom he has custody on weekends. On one such visitation, looking after the kids becomes a little more difficult when, after a series of strange lighting storms hit his neighborhood, Ray discovers that a fleet of death-ray robotic spaceships have emerged nearby, part of the first wave of an all-out alien invasion of the Earth. Transporting his children from New York to Boston in an attempt to find safety at Mary Ann\'s parents\' house, Ray must learn to become the protector and provider he never was in marriage.\r\n\r\nSadly, the hard-working and disillusioned New Jersey dockworker, Ray Ferrier, has failed as a husband, and as a father. Estranged from his troubled teenage son, Robbie, and his little daughter, Rachel, Ray struggles to build bridges with his kids, as his ex-wife, Mary Ann, drops them off at his house for the weekend. But, pretty soon, things will get from bad to worse, when, out of the blue, mysterious electromagnetic pulses and violent sets of lightning flashes start hammering the area, and a full-scale, all-out invasion of a technologically-advanced alien species wreaks havoc on a completely defenceless Earth. Now, Ray must find a way to protect his family, as they all try to reunite with Mary Ann; however, can a single man and a mere mortal alone outsmart the legions of pitiless intergalactic invaders?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nRay Ferrier (Cruise) is a divorced dockworker and less-than-perfect father. When his ex-wife and her new husband drop off his teenage son Robbie and young daughter Rachel for a rare weekend visit, a strange and powerful lightning storm suddenly touches down. What follows is the extraordinary battle for the future of humankind through the eyes of one American family fighting to survive it in this contemporary retelling of H.G. Wells seminal classic sci-fi actioner.\r\n-\r\nMajorwest', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '0000-00-00', '', '2020-08-19 16:49:16', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::14\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nCzech Republic::12\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::12\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::14+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13', 12);

What follows is a perilous trek around the world where Lane must brave horrific dangers and long odds to find answers before human civilization falls.\r\n-\r\nKenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com)\r\n\r\nWhen former U.N. investigator Gerry Lane and his family get stuck in urban gridlock, he senses that it\'s no ordinary traffic jam. His suspicions are confirmed when, suddenly, the city erupts into chaos. A lethal virus, spread through a single bite, is turning healthy people into something vicious, unthinking and feral. As the pandemic threatens to consume humanity, Gerry leads a worldwide search to find the source of the infection and, with luck, a halt to it\'s spread.\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan\r\n\r\nA virulent and unprecedented pandemic of global proportions which turns humans into rabid flesh-eating zombies takes the world by surprise. Under these circumstances, the retired United Nations special agent, Gerry Lane, must leave behind a peaceful family life, a wife and two daughters, to escort a team of scientists on a mission to find a cure, navigating through zombie-swarmed cities. However, as the deadly pathogen obliterates entire areas, incessantly giving birth to diseased masses of freshly-reanimated undead, the frail hope of finding a viable solution starts drifting away. Does humanity have enough time to wait for a miracle?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nHaving retired as U.N. investigator, Gerry Lane devotes his time to wife Karin and their wining brat daughter Constance and Rachel in Philadelphia, until it becomes the next site of a globally spreading mystery epidemic turning bitten people into rabies-like zombies. His clueless former chief, deputy secretary general Thierry Umutoni, recalls him to the UN emergency team, thus offering the whole family a spot aboard the safe air carrier. Gerry joins though army veterans on reconnaissance to Korea, where a rogue CIA agent\'s suggestion proves worthless, then to Israel, where a Mossad \'contrarious tenth man\' had the foresight to respond to a vague Indian pandemic threat by erecting a wall Jerusalem, only to see an undead flood overtake it. His last minute escape flight must deal drastically with an infected passenger before crashing in Cardiff, near a WHO research facility, where he combines and tests a daring out of the box \'camouflage\' strategy inspired by weir observations.\r\n-\r\nKGF Vissers\r\n\r\nRetired U.N. investigator Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) and his family are sitting in what appears to be a typical Philadelphia traffic jam when helicopters began to circle ominously overhead and an explosion throws the city into panic. In the blink of an eye, the streets are consumed by chaos. When Gerry learns that the catalyst for the turmoil is a highly contagious virus that transforms those who contract it into rampaging maniacs and that legions of the infected are growing on all continents, he agrees to join his former colleagues in discovering the source of the rampant plague so that his wife and two daughters will be guaranteed safety aboard a UN fleet in the Atlantic Ocean. Upon tracing a crucial e-mail to a U.S. military base in South Korea, Gerry learns that the infection has spread more rapidly than anyone realizes. Although a subsequent trip to Jerusalem, where the government has constructed a massive wall to keep the public safe, initially offers hope that the growing horde can be kept at bay, an unexpected breach sends Gerry back into the sky in search of patient zero. Just when Gerry thinks he\'s traced the origins of the virus, however, the unthinkable happens. Subsequently stranded in Cardiff with a fearless Israeli soldier, Gerry quickly makes his way to a World Health Organization outpost where the few remaining scientists have hit a dead end in their search for a cure. But the struggle is far from over and after recalling an unusual scene witnessed in Jerusalem, Gerry prepares to make a leap of faith that could prevent the downfall of humanity..', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '0000-00-00', '', '2020-08-19 16:53:47', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nAustria::14\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::14\r\nChina::(Banned)\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMaldives::15+\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::NC-16\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nVietnam::C16', 12),

Having just earned a tidy $100 million for taking down a ruthless criminal kingpin, Dom and Brian (Paul Walker) have decided to lie low for a while. Fugitives from the law, they\'re constantly looking over their shoulders, no matter where they travel. Meanwhile, the malevolent leader of an elusive criminal outfit (Luke Evans) has incurred the wrath of Agent Hobbs, who has decided that the only way to shut them down is to beat them on their own turf. Realizing that Dom knows the only drivers in the world with the skills to get the job done, Agent Hobbs offers them all full pardons if they will come to London, and get back behind the wheel. The closer the renegade drivers get to the organization, however, the more apparent it becomes that Dom\'s former lover Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is not only still alive, but a key figure among their ranks.

Worse, a Somalian terrorist called Jakarde and a shady government official called \"Mr. Nobody\" are both competing to steal a computer terrorism program called \"God\'s Eye,\" that can turn any technological device into a weapon.

But danger is never far for the crew. Their years of peace are altered when Shaw\'s mysterious brother, Deckard, starts chaos starting with federal agent, Luke Hobbs, being badly crippled. Then they have another situation: African-American terrorist, Jakende, hunting them. Now Dom and his friends have to find out how to defeat Shaw and Jakarde, or finally face annihilation all in one last ride.\r\n\r\nAfter defeating Owen Shaw and his crew and securing amnesty for their past crimes (depicted in Fast and Furious 6), Dominic \"Dom\" Toretto, Brian O\'Conner and the rest of their team have returned to the United States to live normal lives again. Brian begins to accustom himself to life as a father, while Dom tries to help Letty Ortiz regain her memory. Meanwhile, Owen\'s older brother, Deckard Shaw, breaks into the secure hospital that the comatose Owen is being held in and swears vengeance against Dom and his team, before breaking into Luke Hobbs\' Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) office to extract profiles of Dom\'s crew. After revealing his identity, Shaw engages Hobbs in a fight, and escapes when he detonates a bomb that severely injures Hobbs. Dom later learns from his sister Mia that she is pregnant again and convinces her to tell Brian.

But when a mysterious woman seduces Dom into the world of crime he can\'t seem to escape, and a betrayal of those closest to him, they will face trials that will test them as never before. From the shores of Cuba and the streets of New York City to the icy plains off the arctic Barents Sea, the elite force will crisscross the globe to stop an anarchist from unleashing chaos on the world\'s stage, and to bring home the man who made them a family.\r\n-\r\nharpreet phamber\r\n\r\nThe family has been doing their normal thing.

Sensing Raldo is a loan shark, Dom challenges Raldo to a race, pitting Fernando\'s re-worked car against Raldo\'s, and wagering his own show car. After narrowly winning the race, Dom allows Raldo to keep his car, earning his respect, and instead leaves his cousin with his show car. The next day, Dom is approached by the elusive terrorist Cipher (Charlize Theron), who coerces him into working for her. Shortly afterwards, Dom and his team, comprising Letty, Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson), Tej Parker (Ludacris), and Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), are recruited by Diplomatic Security Service (D.S.S.) Agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson) to help him retrieve an E.M.P. device from a military outpost in Berlin, Germany. During the getaway, Dom goes rogue, forcing Hobbs off the road and stealing the device for Cipher. Hobbs is arrested and locked up in the same high-security prison in which he helped imprison Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham).', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '0000-00-00', '', '2020-08-21 06:51:01', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::14\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::14\r\nColombia::12\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::17+\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nLuxembourg::12\r\nMalaysia::18\r\nMaldives::18+\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::12\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nThailand::15\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUkraine::16\r\nVietnam::C16', 12);

By the sixth grade, in 1961, Bryce tries to get rid of Juli by dating Sherry Stalls, whom Juli despises. However, Bryce\'s best friend, Garrett, takes an interest in Sherry and eventually tells her the truth about Bryce asking her out; she doesn\'t take it well. From Juli\'s perspective, Bryce returned her feelings, but was shy. After finding out Bryce and Sherry broke up, she thought she could have Bryce back. But then they reconsider their decisions as time goes on. In 1962, Bryce\'s grandfather Chet Duncan moves in with the family. Chet has different views about Juli. There\'s a large, old sycamore tree that Juli loves which no one else understands. One day, it\'s cut down by a group of landscapers so a house can be built there, despite Juli\'s opposition. She becomes very depressed afterwards, as the tree let her see the world in a more enlightened way. Her father gives her a painting of the tree.\r\n\r\n1963. The Loskis and the Bakers have lived across the street from each other since 1957 when the Loskis moved into the neighborhood. They, as families, have never spent any time together socially in the differences especially between the family patriarchs, judgmental Steven Loski who has always viewed the Bakers as beneath him especially since they won\'t even maintain their yard, while free-spirited Richard Baker has other priorities in life with the family\'s limited funds to worry too much about what Steven thinks. Juli Baker, now in the eighth grade, has had a crush on classmate Bryce Loski ever since the Loskis were unloading their moving truck when she and Bryce were in the second grade, and Juli looked deep into Bryce\'s eyes. Bryce, however, has done whatever he felt he needed to do to avoid who he considered overbearing and thus annoying Juli. Bryce\'s maternal grandfather, Chet Duncan, who recently moved in with the Loskis, sees Juli in a different vein, she the rare soul that is a beacon of light, much like his now deceased wife. Several events in Bryce and Juli\'s lives are shown this year - seen individually from Bryce and Juli\'s very different perspectives - that may change the tide in their relationship, the ups and downs which are also affected by external forces combined with the strength or weakness within each of Bryce and Juli.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nJuli Baker devoutly believes in three things: the sanctity of trees (especially her beloved sycamore), the wholesomeness of the eggs she collects from her backyard flock of chickens, and that someday she will kiss Bryce Loski. Ever since she saw Bryce\'s dazzling brown eyes back in second grade, Juli has been smitten. Unfortunately, Bryce has never felt the same. Frankly, he thinks Juli Baker is a little weird--after all, what kind of freak raises chickens and sits in trees for fun? Then, in eighth grade, everything changes. Bryce begins to see that Juli\'s unusual interests and pride in her family are, well, kind of cool. And Juli starts to think that maybe Bryce\'s dazzling brown eyes are as empty as the rest of Bryce seems to be. After all, what kind of jerk doesn\'t care about other people\'s feelings about chickens and trees? With Flipped, mystery author Wendelin Van Draanen has taken a break from her Sammy Keyes series, and the result is flipping fantastic. Bryce and Juli\'s rants and raves about each other ring so true that teen readers will quickly identify with at least one of these hilarious feuding egos, if not both. A perfect introduction to the adolescent war between the sexes.\r\n-\r\nanonymous', 'Blu-ray', 1, 0, '', 0, '0000-00-00', '', '2020-08-22 02:19:37', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Australia::PG\r\nCanada::G\r\nFinland::K-7\r\nFrance::Tous Public\r\nGermany::0\r\nGreece::K-8\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nNetherlands::AL\r\nNew Zealand::PG\r\nNorway::A\r\nRussia::6+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSweden::7\r\nUnited Kingdom::PG\r\nUnited States::PG', 7),

Those frustrations boil over into a raucous viral-videoed public confrontation against a restaurant critic who panned his cooking of food that his boss ordered him to make against his instincts. Now with his career ruined, Carl\'s ex-wife offers an unorthodox solution in Miami: refit an old food truck to offer quality cooking on his own terms. Now with his young son, Percy, and old colleague, Martin, helping, Carl takes a working trip across America with that truck to rediscover his gastronomic passion. With Percy\'s tech savvy and Martin\'s enthusiasm, Carl finds that he is creating a traveling sensation on the way home. In doing so, Carl discovers he is serving up more than simply food, but also a deeper connection with his life and his family that is truly delicious in its own way.\r\n-\r\nKenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com)\r\n\r\nMiami-born Carl Casper is the head chef of Gauloise in Brentwood, California. While popular with his kitchen staff and hostess Molly, the restaurant owner Riva wants Carl to stick to \"classics\" rather than innovative dishes. Carl has a strained relationship with his tech-savvy preteen son Percy and rich ex-wife Inez. When Carl has the chance to serve prestigious critic and blogger Ramsey Michel, Riva demands he stick with old favorites at the last minute; Carl concedes, leading to a scathing review. On Twitter, Carl insults Ramsey for the review, not realizing that his reply is public, and gains a large Twitter following. Carl comes up with a new menu that his staff loves and invites Ramsey to a \"rematch\"; however, he quits after confronting Riva, who wants the old menu again..\r\n\r\nLos Angeles-based executive chef Carl Casper was once deemed the one to watch within the business. But years working for Riva at upscale Gauloise, Riva who promised him creative control but who has ended up dictating that he cater the menu and his cooking to the tastes of the masses, Carl has lost that promise, although his staff, including his sous chef Tony, the sommelier Molly, but especially one of the line cooks Martin, still admire his talent. Carl may not realize how much this stifling has affected his psyche, that negativity which led to the dissolution of his marriage to Inez, and he having a strained relationship with his and Inez\'s ten year old son Percy, who only wants to spend quality time with his physically present but mentally absent father in their mandated time together. In being a social media newbie, Carl ends up having a very public breakdown. In the aftermath, Carl, with nothing else he wants to do but be a chef, has to reinvent himself in some manner to get back on his feet. He decides to take Inez up a long standing offer concerning her first husband, Miami-based entrepreneur Marvin who has a hygiene fetish. Despite not fully trusting Marvin, Carl may rediscover his passion for cooking and in the process his passion for life in general, that passion which may bring those things of importance that he has lost in the ten years back.\r\n-\r\nHuggo', 'Blu-ray', 1, 0, '', 0, '0000-00-00', '', '2020-08-22 02:44:38', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::8\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nColombia::T\r\nDenmark::A\r\nFinland::S\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::6\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::6\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::9\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::A\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::NC16\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::A\r\nSweden::Btl\r\nSwitzerland::8\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R', 13),

With the help of his best friend, his mother, and a young therapist at the cancer center, Adam learns what and who the most important things in his life are.\r\n-\r\nCalikeane\r\n\r\nAdam is a methodical twenty-seven year old writer of radio programs that lives together with his girlfriend Rachael that is a painter. His best friend is Kyle that does not like Rachael and Adam is estranged of his overprotective mother Diane, who takes care of her husband Richard that has Alzheimer. When Adam feels a pain on his back, he goes to the doctor and is diagnosed of spinal cancer. He researches in Internet and he sees that his odds are 50% of healing. He goes to chemotherapy and is helped by the twenty-four year-old therapist Katherine. Along the treatment, Adam finds more about the feelings of Rachael, Katherine and Kyle and he realizes how much his mother loves him.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nAdam is 27, working for public radio in Seattle. He consults a doctor about his back pains and gets a terrible diagnosis - a rare form of cancer that\'s fatal half the time. Chemo starts immediately. His best friend Kyle, and his girlfriend, Rachael, vow to see him through it. Rachael helps keep his dramatic mother at bay, he meets some of the regulars at chemo, and he\'s assigned a grad-student psychologist, Katherine: he\'s her third patient, and she tries to say the right things, often without effect. Kyle wants to turn Adam\'s cancer into a chick magnet, Rachael keeps Adam at arm\'s length, Adam doesn\'t answer his mom\'s calls, and the chemo saps his strength. The clock ticks.\r\n-\r\n\r\nDespite leading an extremely healthy lifestyle, which includes no smoking, no drinking, no drugs and not even possessing a driver\'s license to partake in what he considers the associated dangerous activity, twenty-seven year old Seattle Public Radio journalist Adam Lerner is diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. After getting over the initial shock of the diagnosis upon which he could not focus after the word \"cancer\", Adam reads online about his specific type - schwannoma neurofibrosarcoma - the article he reads which reports a 50% survival rate. His primary physician, Dr. Ross, prescribes a course of chemotherapy to shrink the tumor before they can even contemplate the dangerous surgery to remove the remainder of the malignant growth which is located on his spine. Beyond the variety of emotions Adam goes through related to his diagnosis and his treatment, he also goes through a range of emotions in relation to the help and support provided by the various people in his life. They include: Diane Lerner, his overbearing mother who he believes has become even more overbearing with this news, especially as her life is spent solely dealing with Adam\'s father\'s Alzheimer\'s; Rachael, his girlfriend, who had to decide whether to stay with him as they were just at point of taking their relationship to that next level or calling it quits when Adam was first diagnosed; Kyle, his SPR colleague and best friend, who tries to cheer Adam up by the positive, mostly in that Adam can get laid by anyone he wants by playing the sympathy card (and in turn Kyle can get his fair share riding on Adam\'s coattails); Alan Lombardo and Mitch Barnett, two older fellow chemo patients who become the human faces of cancer to Adam; and Katherine McKay, a twenty-four year old Ph.D. candidate who is assigned his psychological therapist, he who is only her third such patient which shows in her sometimes awkward but well meaning textbook actions.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nWritten by Will Reiser who based the film on his own experiences fighting cancer, Jonathan Levine\'s poignant comedy 50/50 stars Joseph Gordonn-Levitt as Adam, a 27-year-old public-radio employee who discovers he has cancer. As his best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen) tries to help out, his girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) proves to be a less than ideal life partner for this particular crisis.

Injecting some much needed energy into their repertoire, The Bellas take on their male rivals in a campus competition.\r\n-\r\nAnonymous\r\n\r\nThe Barden Bellas are a collegiate, all-girls a cappella singing group thriving on female pop songs and their perfect looks. After a disastrous failing at last year\'s finals, they are forced to regroup. Among the new recruits is freshman Beca, an independent, aspiring DJ with no interest in the college life. But after she meets Jesse, from the rival all-male a cappella group, Beca has a new outlook and takes it upon herself to help the Bellas find their new look and sound and get back into the competition.\r\n-\r\nnapierslogs\r\n\r\nBarden College sports four different a cappella singing groups, the all-male Treblemakers and the all-female Bellas, who are the most antagonistic toward each other of the four, making it into the national finals of the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCAC), held annually at Lincoln Center in New York City. The Bellas are the first all-female group to make the finals, but what strides they make forward for all women singing take two major steps backward at the finals with tired, uninspired arrangements solely of twentieth century girl songs, and an unfortunate incident by their controlling lead, Aubrey Posen, whose choice of singers has to be clones of her pretty self. As such, Aubrey and co-lead Chloe Beale have to rebuild the group from scratch for the upcoming season, which will be difficult due to the notoriety from the incident at the finals. Meanwhile, Beca Mitchell is a reluctant freshman at Barden, her Barden professor father paying for her tuition for one year just so that she can be exposed to college life. Her reluctance is that she is a loner, she preferring to work on her music mixes in solitude in her want to be a Los Angeles DJ or music producer. Although she is made aware of the Bellas in her wanderings around campus, Beca has no intention of auditioning, until she meets Chloe, who encourages her to do so. Beca is accepted with a more diverse group than has ever been the Bellas, but Beca and Aubrey end up clashing over Aubrey\'s direction for the group, which she mistakenly believes is the winning direction. One of Aubrey\'s other zero tolerance policies is no sex with any Treblemaker. Although Beca has no intention of breaking that policy, she does admit that one of the few people on campus she has befriended beyond the other women in the Bellas is fellow music lover and singer Jesse Swanson, an aspiring film score composer and a freshman Treblemaker. Beca will have to decide how far to break out of her shell and stay true to her own musical leanings, which if she does so means taking on Aubrey for some control of the group. What Beca decides may also affect what happens in her friendship with Jesse.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nA feisty coed joins a collegiate a Capella group and upgrades their song selection for the 21st century during the run-up to a major competition in this melodic comedy from Tony-nominated Avenue Q director Jason Moore. Drifting past the various cliques after arriving at college, Beca (Anna Kendrick) pays more attention to the jams pumping in her headphones than the people she passes on her way to class. But all that changes the moment she stumbles into the one place where every misfit has a voice -- the campus a Capella group. Although the competition among st the singers proves surprisingly fierce, there\'s just one aspect of the group Beca can\'t wrap her head around: All of the songs they perform are at least a decade old. Convinced that they can do better by adding some contemporary tunes into the mix, Beca whips up an exciting new set list that will set the group apart and leave their rivals in the dust.', 'Blu-ray', 1, 0, '', 0, '0000-00-00', '', '2020-08-22 02:48:46', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::PG\r\nDenmark::A\r\nFinland::K-7\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::0\r\nHungary::12\r\nIndonesia::13+\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::A\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::Btl\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13', 0),

Aided only by his idiotic imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi), Jojo must confront his blind nationalism.\r\n-\r\nFox Searchlight Pictures\r\n\r\n1944 Germany. Ten year old Johannes Betzler, more commonly called Jojo, is the son of good Germans, his father away fighting in Italy, while he is under the care of his mother Rosie, with his older sister Inge recently having passed away from illness. With only one true friend in the form of same aged, bespectacled Yorki, Jojo, in wanting to fit in, is arguably entering what he would consider the most important phase of his young life in attending a Nazi youth camp presided over by Captain Klenzendorf, Captain K\'s almost too faithful assistant Freddy Finkel, and FrÃ¤ulein Rahm, who takes Nazi policies in a slightly off-kilter direction. Despite being considered an outsider by most of the other youth in town, Jojo figures he has a leg up on everyone else at camp in that he is constantly being guided by the spirit of Der FÃ¼hrer himself, Adolf Hitler, whose personal bodyguard Jojo aspires to be when he grows up. In his general day-to-day life but also supported by his time at camp, Jojo has a hatred for Jewish people despite not really knowing anything about them or ever having met anyone of the Jewish faith, the ultimate goal to kill them. So when Jojo meets someone Jewish for the first time, especially as that meeting is in what is for him the most unlikely of circumstances, Jojo has to figure out what to do. While truly believing he is a Nazi despite not really knowing what that means, he has to decide either to follow what he has been taught in hating and trying to kill any Jewish person despite knowing that killing is not in his true nature, or not, which may have larger consequences with relation to family. While he decides, he truly gets to know the person beyond the label of \"Jewish\" which may factor into what happens.\r\n-\r\nAdolf Hitler\r\n\r\nIn the waning months of the Third Reich, the unpopular ten-year-old German boy, Johannes \"Jojo\" Betzler, can\'t wait to join the ranks of the Nazi Party\'s youth organisation, during an intense training weekend that guarantees to separate the men from the boys. Massively into swastikas and ready to give up his life for his megalomaniac idol, Adolf Hitler, instead, the FÃ¼hrer\'s tiny number one fan gets kicked out of the Hitler Youth after a disastrous first assignment in front of his peers--an ignominious defeat that earns Jojo an equally degrading nickname. Now, with nothing but time on his hands, Johannes is in for a rude awakening when he accidentally unearths his progressive mother\'s well-hidden secret and comes face-to-face with a shocking new reality so much different from the hypnotic indoctrinations he\'s absorbed. But, does everything happen for a reason? Are the others always the enemy? In a mad world, devoured by fear and prejudice, is youthful innocence humankind\'s redemption?\r\n-\r\nAdolf Hitler', 'Blu-ray', 1, 0, '', 0, '0000-00-00', '', '2020-08-22 02:50:18', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::PG\r\nChile::14\r\nColombia::12\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::12\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::12\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13', 12),

Newly elected President Mandela knows his nation remains racially and economically divided in the wake of Apartheid. Believing he can bring his people together through the universal language of sport, Mandela rallies South Africa\'s rugby team as they make their yeetboi run to the 1995 Rugby World Cup Championship match.\r\n-\r\nalfiehitchie\r\n\r\nNelson Mandela\'s (Morgan Freeman\'s) release from prison and his ascent to a democratically elected President of South Africa marks a radical change in the country. This change away from Apartheid will not be easy for anyone in the country, but Mandela has to figure out how to galvanize the residents of the country together. Because of his love of the game, Mandela places his support behind the Springboks, the national rugby team. South Africa is hosting the 1995 Rugby World Cup, that being the only reason the Springboks are even competing in the tournament as its years on the sideline of world rugby events has not made it world ranked. The Springboks were previously considered the team of white South Africa, and as such was denounced by Mandela when he was in prison. But he does whatever he can to make it the team of all South Africa. He needs the support of the Springboks and its Captain, Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) to achieve his unrealistic goal of the Springboks winning the World Cup, even against such rugby powerhouses the All-Blacks representing New Zealand. Mandela tries to inspire Pienaar to lead by example, much like Mandela has. Beyond Mandela\'s dream, his racially mixed security team has the added pressure of protecting him at the Springboks\' matches while he places himself in potentially unprotectable situations.\r\n-\r\nNelson Mandela\r\n\r\nNelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) after being elected President, sets to bring his divided country together. But it won\'t be easy because there are those who still resent the presence of the Afrikaaners who oppressed them. They want to get rid of all symbols of their oppression, amongst them is the National Rugby team, the Springboks, which for many is a major symbol of their oppression. But Mandela chooses to stand up for them. With the World Cup approaching, Mandela sends for the team Captain, Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon), and he subtly tells him that he wants them to win the World Cup. So they train, but Mandela decides to show them for what they are playing by making them teach rugby in small townships and spend some time in the prison where he was held for twenty-seven years.\r\n-\r\nrcs0411@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nOn February 11, 1990, Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) was released after twenty-seven years imprisoned in Robben Island. In 1994, he is elected President of South Africa and he tries to unite his nation that is divided by Apartheid. Around the time of the Rugby World Cup in 1995, held in South Africa, Nelson Mandela invites the Captain of the Springboks Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) to come to the government palace for a tea and inspires Francois to win the championship with his team.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil', 'Blu-ray', 1, 0, '', 0, '0000-00-00', '', '2020-08-22 02:51:13', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::PG\r\nBrazil::Livre\r\nCanada::G\r\nFinland::S\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nIreland::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::A\r\nNetherlands::AL\r\nNorway::A\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::PG\r\nSouth Korea::All\r\nSweden::Btl\r\nSwitzerland::7\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13', 0),

When his granddaughter Ginny (Taissa Farmiga) is celebrating her engagement with her fiancÃ©, Earl is completely broke, and agrees to become a mule above any suspicion for the Mexican cartel, transporting drugs under the alias of \"Tata\". He makes money and resolves many financial issues of his family and friends. Meanwhile, efficient D.E.A. Agent Colin Bates (Bradley Cooper) is in charge of investigating the notorious cartel and the mysterious Tata with his partner Agent TreviÃ±o (Michael PeÃ±a).\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nDue to financial problems, an 80-something-year-old man, Earl Stone, takes a job as a drug mule, driving shipments between Texas and Illinois for a Mexican cartel. Unbeknownst to him, the DEA are targeting the cartel, resulting in Earl being the central figure in their investigations.\r\n-\r\ngrantss\r\n\r\n2001. Earl Stone is a 73-year-old gardener obsessed with his work as horticulturist and the conventions where he win prizes by his dedication to lilies. Living in Illionis, divorced many years ago of Mary, the relation with her and his estranged daughter Iris worsens after Earl forgets Iris\' wedding by assisting to another convention. His attempt to reconcile with them ends very bad, and Earl turns in a goner for all them. 17 years later, Internet has ruined 90-year-old Earl\'s life, his house is notice of eviction and his business is under foreclose. After a tense meeting between him and his family by Ginny\'s feast by her incoming wedding, a friend of Ginny closes Earl to offer a new business: move from Texas to Illinois another transporting bags each time more big. Unknown for him, a DEA\'s agent recently transferred from Washington DC to Chicago called Colin Bates starts an investigation to dismantle a drug cartel belonging Laton, a Mexican powerful drug boss. With Mexican DEA\'s agent Trevino as partner, Bates locates one thug of the cartel named Luis Rocha, blackmailing to work as informer for him. Meanwhile, Earl\'s new job starts to give unexpected results: after the veteran center where he meets with his Korean War\'s partners is burned by accident, Earl decides use the money to restore him, and secretly helps Ginny to pay her studies. But, unable to be for more time not knowing what he moves, Earl opens a bag in the middle of a travel, discovering the drug. Keeping the secret for everyone, he is invited to Mexico for meeting Laton and approaches Mary and Iris in the hope to be forgiven by the mistakes along his life. Learning much late the true sense of life and family, Earl tries to make good the things, but these complicates in bad terms: Laton is killed by his henchman Gustavo, Mary suddenly gets seriously ill, and Bates and Trevino are noticed about a new drug mail named \"Tata\" (the way Mexican drug traffickers call Earl) who is moving big amounts of drug. At the same time that Mary\'s health worsens and Gustavo despises Earl giving order to kill him, Bates leads an undercover op to catch Tata, in a race against time where Earl\'s life never will be the same.\r\n-\r\nChockys', 'Blu-ray', 1, 0, '', 0, '0000-00-00', '', '2020-08-22 02:54:13', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBelgium::KT/EA\r\nBrazil::16\r\nBulgaria::C\r\nCanada::14A\r\nChile::14\r\nChina::Approved\r\nColombia::12\r\nCzech Republic::15\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::17+\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-16\r\nLuxembourg::12\r\nMalaysia::(Banned)\r\nMalta::15\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNigeria::18\r\nNorway::12\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPortugal::M/14\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTaiwan::R-15\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUkraine::16', 18),

Eventually, Dave escapes traumatized throughout adulthood. Jimmy is an ex-con and a father of three, whose daughter Katie, is found dead, and Dave becomes the number one suspect. Sean is a homicide detective, investigating Katie\'s murder, ends up finding himself faced with past and present demons as more is uncovered about Katie\'s murder. Learning Katie had a boyfriend, ballistics later turn up a gun belonging to the father, which then puts her boyfriend as the suspect. Will Sean find out who killed Katie? Will Jimmy make it through the investigation? And will Dave ever find out what really happened when he was abducted?\r\n-\r\nmichigans_finest\r\n\r\nIn the aftermath of a deeply traumatic incident in a close-knit mid-1970s Boston neighbourhood, three childhood friends--the reformed criminal, Jimmy; the forever scarred blue-collar worker, Dave, and the methodical Massachusetts State Police Detective, Sean--are still trying to find their feet, nearly three decades later. Then--as if having to cope with the dark past wasn\'t enough--Jimmy\'s innocent nineteen-year-old daughter, Katie, ends up brutally murdered, and, somehow, troubled Dave\'s name comes first in the list of suspects. Once more, even though he tried so hard to renounce his former self, Jimmy picks up where he left off, bent on unearthing the unknown sadistic killer. However, can more blood appease the pain of a parent?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nSummer, 1975. In a tight blue-collar Boston neighborhood, three kids are playing when one is abducted and sexually abused for several days. Jump ahead: the victim, Dave, is haunted by memories and protective of his own son. Jimmy is an ex-con and father of three. Sean is a homicide detective, estranged from his pregnant wife. When Jimmy\'s teen daughter Katie dies, Sean investigates, Dave\'s a suspect, and Jimmy vows to find the killer before the cops. The dead girl has a boyfriend whose long-missing father has a history with Jimmy. The boyfriend\'s a suspect, and when ballistics turns up a link to a gun owned by the young man\'s father, the case breaks.

He is aided by the pierced, tattooed, punk computer hacker named Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara). As they work together in the investigation, Blomkvist and Salander uncover immense corruption beyond anything they have ever imagined.\r\n-\r\nDaniel Craig\r\n\r\nMikael Blomkvist is a disgraced journalist who is asked by a wealthy industrialist to write a biography on his family. But what he really wants Blomkvist to do is to find out what happened to his niece, who went missing 40 years ago. Blomkvist, at first, is not interested, till the man offers to help him clear his name. Blomkvist, begins by talking to the man\'s relatives who were there when the girl went missing. And some of them are not forth coming. Blomkvist eventually believes that her disappearance might have something to do with some serial killings that took place 20 years before she disappeared. So he asks for a research assistant. So the industrialist\'s man suggests Lisbeth Salander, a talented hacker who does background checks for them and who even did one on Blomkvist. When he sees her report, he\'s impressed and asks her to work with him and she does. She\'s anti-social but is extremely efficient.\r\n-\r\nrcs0411@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nAfter being successfully sued for libel by a wealthy industrialist, investigative journalist Mikael Blomqvist leaves his magazine Millennium and accepts an offer from Henrik Vanger to write the Vanger family history. An old industrial family, the Vangers have their share of skeletons in their closet. What Henrik is most interested in learning however is what happened to his niece, Harriet Vanger, who he is certain was murdered by a member of his family in the summer of 1966. Mikael takes on the task and moves into a small cottage on the Vanger estate. He begins to decipher some of the clues Harriet has left behind and decides to get an assistant, computer hacker Lisbeth Salander, the woman who did the very thorough background check on him for Vanger. Together, they learn of some of the Vangers deep, violent secrets.\r\n-\r\ngarykmcd\r\n\r\nStockholm-based Mikael Blomkvist, co-owner and co-editor of Millennium magazine, has just lost a high profile libel case resulting from an article he wrote on businessman Hans-Erik WennerstrÃ¶m. This loss has the potential to ruin Mikael professionally. As such, he leaves the magazine in the hands of the other co-owner/co-editor, Erika Berger, with who he is openly having an affair, which ruined his marriage. Even in Erika\'s hands, the magazine is also suffering because of the scandal and resulting loss of ad revenue. Because of Mikael\'s investigative abilities as a journalist, he receives an offer by wealthy and aged Henrik Vanger: solve the forty year old cold case of his missing and presumed dead grandniece, Harriet Vanger, who was only sixteen at the time of her disappearance. Despite Henrik\'s generous financial compensation, which could also save the magazine, Mikael is unconvinced to do the work until Henrik adds one additional piece of compensation that money can\'t buy. Mikael will largely do the work on Hedeby Island just off of Hedestad in northern Sweden, the island where Harriet was last seen, and where most of the dysfunctional extended Vanger family still lives, they who are among the suspects. To the family, Mikael is solely writing a chronicle of the Vanger family, without them knowing that his primary task is to find Harriet\'s killer. As Mikael proceeds with his investigation, he asks for a research assistant. Who Henrik\'s lawyer recommends is a young woman named Lisbeth Salanger, who conducted the background check on Mikael which Henrik ordered in preparation to hire him for this job. Mikael agrees with the choice when he sees that check she did of him, he knowing that she could only have found out key pieces of information through one means, which could help in this matter. Lisbeth is a brilliant investigator, but troubled in her personal life, which includes being under state guardianship due to incidents that happened while she was growing up. Despite what he knows of Lisbeth through her research of him, and despite her alternative appearance, Mikael begins to trust her, and she him - the first person she trusts in establishment in a long time - as they tie Harriet\'s disappearance to a series of what look to be murders of young women leading up to the disappearance. Through the case, Lisbeth begins to see a different life for herself, while Mikael has the larger goal of regaining his good name by knowing that WennerstrÃ¶m is much what he wrote.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nMikael Blomkvist is a Journalist who accused a company for various scandals that turn out to be false. After another birthday flower, Henrick Vanger, a wealthy business owner, hires Mikael to investigate his family of 30 in order to find the truth of his niece\'s death/dissaperance that was never solved 40 years prior. He claims one of them is responsible for her death and the torture of sending him the flowers in attempt to crush him because they want what he has, the vanger business. Lisbeth Salander is a hacker at Milton Security and was also hired to do a background check on Mikael. She was found legally incompetent at a young age and has had a legal guardian who was assigned by the state. After a stroke, she is assigned a new guardian (NILS BJURMAN) who from the first meeting seems to have unprofessional sexual intentions for Lisbeth. For years Lisbeth was stable enough to handle her own finances yet BJURMAN feels he needs to be in charge and tells her if she wants money she is to come to him personally to get it approved. She later sends Mikael an email he can easily trace giving him valuable information on the Vanger investigation that makes Mikael compelled to ask for her help. As they work together Mikael is not blind to the fact that Lisbeth has lived a brutal and torturous past that would cause her to be trusting of anyone. Yet that doesn\'t stop him from developing an intimate attraction for her. Even though her past haunts her and she finds it impossible to trust anyone, Mikael somehow finds a way into her heart. The Bible verses Lisbeth found from Harriet\'s Bible(the information Lisbeth sent to Mikael) send the two of them on a hunt for a sadistic and gruesome rapist/murderer within the Vanger family.\r\n-\r\nbmamabear', 'Blu-ray', 1, 0, '', 0, '0000-00-00', '', '2020-08-22 03:06:20', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::18\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nFinland::K-15\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nHong Kong::III\r\nIndia::(Banned)\r\nIreland::18\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nJapan::R18+\r\nLithuania::N-16\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::R-18\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::R21\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nUnited Kingdom::18\r\nUnited States::R', 18);

They must undergo extreme physical and intense psychological tests, that transform them all. But Tris has a secret that she is Divergent, which means she doesn\'t fit into any one group. If anyone knew, it would mean a certain death. As she discovers a growing conflict that threatens to unravel her seemingly peaceful society, this secret might help her save the people she loves... or it might destroy her.\r\n-\r\nanonymous\r\n\r\nIn a futuristic Chicago, society is divided into 5 factions. Abnegation the selfless, Dauntless the brave, Erudite the intelligent, Candor the honest, and Amity the peaceful. When all teenagers reach the age of 16, they must choose to either stay in their faction of birth, or transfer into another faction. Beatrice Prior must make the decision to stay with her family in a faction she feels she isn\'t right for, or to transfer into another faction, and leave her family behind. What follows is a highly competitive initiation, where the newly renamed Tris must make some tough decisions, but she must also keep a secret that she was warned could mean death, while she juggles friends, initiation, and a newfound love interest.

It\'s been four years since the alien-seeking agents averted an intergalactic disaster of epic proportions. And now it\'s a race against the clock as Jay must convince Kay-who not only has absolutely no memory of his time spent with the Men In Black, but is also the only living person left with the expertise to save the galaxy-to reunite with the MIB before the earth submits to ultimate destruction.\r\n-\r\nAnthony Pereyra {hypersonic91@yahoo.com}\r\n\r\nIn 1978, a race of aliens came to Earth and asked the MIB to help protect their greatest treasure which they call \"the Light\" which is a source of awesome power. But it\'s not in their mandate to do that so they tell them they can\'t and send them away. But in the present day, Serleeena an alien who wants the light comes to Earth because she suspects that the MIB did hide it. So she goes to MIB headquarters and takes it over. Zed tells J, that he has to get K who was the one who dealt with the aliens in 1978, to come back. But problem is that K\'s memory has been erased so when J tells him, he doesn\'t believe him but J eventually convinces him. So they head back so that he could be deneuralized but since Serleena took over the HQ where the deneuralizer is, they have to find another one. They eventually do and restore his memory but problem is K doesn\'t remember what happened to the light. But because of some clues K planted, they try to figure out what happened to the light.\r\n-\r\nrcs0411@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nFive long years have passed since the retirement and neuralyzation of Agent K, and now, the mysterious death of a harmless alien calls for the help of Agent J and his unstable new partner. In the meantime--as the Kylothian shape-shifting alien, Serleena, and her double-headed minion are in search of the enigmatic Light of Zartha--inevitably, the Agency will have no other choice but to reverse K\'s neuralyzation, in high hopes of solving this baffling conundrum. However, once more, time is against them--and what is even more disheartening--the dangerously seductive Serleena is after them, using a powerless human as leverage. Will the agents manage to find the Light of Zartha and save the earth, again?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nIt has been four years since the alien-seeking agents averted an intergalactic disaster of epic proportions. Kay has since returned to the comforts of civilian life while Jay continues to work for the Men in Black, the highly funded yet unofficial government agency that regulates all things alien on earth. While investigating a seemingly routine crime, Jay uncovers a diabolical plot masterminded by Serleena, an evil Kylothian monster who disguises herself as a sexy lingerie model. It\'s a race against the clock as Jay must convince Kay--who not only has no memory of his time spent with the agency, but is also the only person alive who has the expertise to save the galaxy--to reunite with the MIB before Earth is destroyed completely.\r\n-\r\nSujit R. Varma\r\n\r\nKay and Jay are back in black as the scum-fighting super-agents - regulators of all things alien on planet Earth. Their latest mission: to save the world from a total intergalactic disaster. When a renegade Kylothian monster disguised as a lingerie model threatens the survival of the human race, the boys of the MIB get the call to step up and get busy. With their headquarters under siege and time running out, Agents Kay and Jay enlist the help of Frank the Pug and a posse of hard-living worms to help them kick some seriously sexy alien butt.\r\n-\r\nOfficial DVD cover', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '0000-00-00', '', '2020-08-26 14:32:03', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::PG\r\nAustria::10\r\nBrazil::Livre\r\nCanada::G\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-11\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nIceland::LH\r\nIndia::U\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::A\r\nMongolia::PG\r\nNetherlands::MG6\r\nNew Zealand::PG\r\nNorway::11\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Africa::PG\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::7\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nUnited Kingdom::PG\r\nUnited States::PG-13', 0);

When he does so, Agent J (Will Smith) realizes that the timeline has been changed and he too travels back to July 15, 1969, the day before Agent K is killed. After overcoming some disbelief, J manages to convince young K and others of just who he is and why he\'s there. With the help of Griffin (Michael Stuhlbarg), a being who can see all timelines, they track Boris down. J also learns a secret, something old Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) had never told him.\r\n-\r\ngarykmcd\r\n\r\nWhen Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement), an alien who is the last of his race, is confined to LunarMax, a penal colony on the moon, he escapes and goes to Earth to get the man who placed him there, M.I.B. Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones). He confronts K, K and J (Will Smith) corner him, but he disappears. J asks K who he is, but K doesn\'t want to say anything. J goes to M.I.B. Headquarters and learns who Boris is, but before he could learn more, the Agent in charge, O (Dame Emma Thompson), stops him. The next day, J goes to pick up K, but finds someone else living at his apartment. When he goes to M.I.B., he looks for K, but everyone there tells him, K died in 1969 after tackling with Boris. But J says K captured him. That\'s when alien vessels which are from Boris\' planet show up, and they\'re about to devour the Earth. But J says that K placed a barrier that keeps them from entering Earth in 1969, which would lead to their extinction. It\'s obvious that Boris went back in time and killed K before he could deploy the barrier. So J goes to see an alien on Earth whose father was also at the penal colony, who J assumes told Boris that he worked on time travel and his son has the device. J goes to see him and tells him about the invasion. So he sends J back just before K\'s death. J arrives in 1969 and fails to stop Boris and is captured by the younger K (Josh Brolin) who asks him who he is, and what is he doing here. J was told not to tell him anything. But with time running out J tells him, but K doesn\'t believe him at first, so they go out to stop Boris. Only problem, J doesn\'t exactly know what happened, so he\'s not sure where they should go.\r\n-\r\nrcs0411@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nCriminal Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) escapes from LunarMax, a moon-based maximum security prison. He comes to Earth seeking revenge on Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones), who shot off his arm and arrested him forty years ago, and protected Earth from a Boglodyte invasion. Boris is defeated again, and he travels back in time to 1969 to kill Agent K (Josh Brolin). When Agent J notes that the timeline has changed in the present day and Agent O (Dame Emma Thompson) tells him that K died in 1969, he decides to travel to July 15, 1969 to save K the following day. Agent J has difficulties to convince the Young Agent K with lies, but when he decides to tell the truth, K believes in his words and they seek out Boris together. They are helped by the amicable alien Griiffin (Jemaine Clement), who has precognitive powers and gives the ArcNet to K to protect Earth from the Boglodyte invasion. Furthermore, J learns a secret about K and himself.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nAgents J (Will Smith) and K (Tommy Lee Jones) have seen some inexplicable things in Agent J\'s fourteen years with the Men In Black intelligence agency. When an alien assassin by the name of Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) escapes from the LunarMax prison, all bets are off. Time travel has been discovered and Boris tracks down the people who are responsible for creating it. Boris travels back in time to 1969 - the year that Agent K had shot off his arm and deployed a shield that led to Boris\' race\'s extinction. As Agent J delves deep into the case, he soon finds himself travelling back to 1969. There, he meets the young Agent K (Josh Brolin) - who is every bit as awkward and demeaning as the elder Agent K is. J and K have their differences, but soon discovers that Boris has a much more sinister motive than originally thought. With the help of an alien super being named Griffin who can see into alternate realities, J and K begin a pursuit of Boris The Animal that takes them to Cape Canaveral, Florida just in time for the Apollo 11 launch. There, secrets that could change time and space forever are revealed.\r\n-\r\nhalo1k\r\n\r\nAfter nearly four decades of imprisonment, the hideous extraterrestrial and Agent K\'s arch-nemesis, Boris the Animal, manages to escape the lunar maximum-security prison, Lunar Max, bent on revenge. With this in mind, the powerful alien travels back in time to 1969, where a fresh and inexperienced version of a young Agent K exists; however, Agent J, too, takes a step back in history, teaming up with his old/new taciturn companion, to thwart the interplanetary visitor\'s evil schemes. Nevertheless, can this brand-new team of reluctant partners re-establish order and peace in the universe?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '0000-00-00', '', '2020-08-26 14:32:44', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::10\r\nCanada::PG\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::A\r\nMongolia::PG\r\nNetherlands::9\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::11\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::7\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nUnited Kingdom::PG\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nVietnam::P', 12),

With Cypher injured, Kitai must embark on a perilous journey to signal for help.\r\n-\r\nSony Pictures Entertainment\r\n\r\nOne thousand years after cataclysmic events forced humanity\'s escape from Earth, Nova Prime has become mankind\'s new home. Legendary General Cypher Raige returns from an extended tour of duty to his estranged family, ready to be a father to his 13-year-old son, Kitai. When an asteroid storm damages Cypher and Kitai\'s craft, they crash-land on a now unfamiliar and dangerous Earth. As his father lies dying in the cockpit, Kitai must trek across the hostile terrain to recover their rescue beacon. His whole life, Kitai has wanted nothing more than to be a soldier like his father. Today, he gets his chance.\r\n-\r\nColumbia Pictures\r\n\r\nIn the future, Earth becomes inhabitable and mankind moves to Nova Prime. However, aliens try to conquer Nova Prime but are defeated by the Rangers under the command of General Cypher Raige. The aliens bring the predator Ursas to hunt down the humans attracted by their fear and Raige develops the fearless ghosting technique to defeat them. On the same day that Raige returns home, his estranged son Kitai Raige is not advanced to the Ranger position in the academy. Raige promises his wife that he will travel in his last assignment before retirement and she convinces him to bring Kitai with him. When their spacecraft is damaged by an asteroid storm, she crashes on Earth and only Raige and Kitai survive. Raige breaks both legs and Kitai needs to cross the hostile and dangerous planet to retrieve the beacon and save their lives.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nIt\'s been nearly a millennium since mankind was forced to flee their home planet for the safety of Nova Prime, and in that time Earth has grown increasingly hostile to human life. Gen. Cypher Raige (Will Smith) has just finished an extended tour of duty when he reunites with his 13-year-old son Kitai (Jaden Smith), and begins making the transition from military leader to father. When an asteroid storm damages their ship, however, a badly injured Cypher and his son are forced to crash-land on Earth. Now, the only way for young Kitai to save his father\'s life is to find the rescue beacon that was lost when their ship came plummeting through the atmosphere. In order to survive and succeed, Kitai will have to become the type of soldier who would make his father proud..\r\n\r\nEager to follow in his father\'s footsteps--the battle-hardened General Cypher Raige--his teenage son and hopeful ranger, Kitai, will find himself fighting for his life when an unforeseen catastrophe during a routine space voyage maroons both on a quarantined and perilous Earth.

But, with her mentor out of the picture and a huge target on her back, Harley locks horns with Gotham City\'s ruthless crime lord, Roman Sionis, who\'s trying to track down a precious diamond and the audacious pickpocket, Cassandra Cain. Now, on the hunt for the teen street hustler and the gemstone, Quinn crosses paths with singer, Dinah Lance, Detective Renee Montoya, and a mysterious crossbow-wielding murderess who are all also after the girl, as Roman\'s top assassin, Victor Zsasz, is bent on getting Cain first.

When awoken he finds himself in a Zombie Apocalypse. Not knowing what to do he sets out to find his family, after he\'s done that, he gets connected to a group to become the leader. He takes charge and tries to help this group of people survive, find a place to live and get them food.

He meets a group on the outskirts of Atlanta and, soon, becomes their leader. The walkers (what they call zombies) feed on the living, so they try to move to different and safer locations to survive.\r\n\r\nRick Grimes was the sheriff at King County police office, until one day he and his partner Shane Walsh get a call about two men in a car with guns, during that call Rick gets shot and goes into a coma, he wakes up to a world where the dead come back to life.\r\n\r\nSherrif Deputy Rick Grimes has been shot. He falls into a coma and wakes up in a hospital, only to find that it is in ruins. He finds a group of survivors and adapts himself to the only survivors left in the city, then little did he know he soon becomes known as the leader. Sherrif Deputy Rick Grimes has to get the small group he attached himself to to safety, food and water. The only thing that stops them is the Walkers, also known as Zombies.\r\n\r\nThe Walking Dead tells the story of the months and years that follow after a zombie apocalypse. It follows a group of survivors, led by former police officer Rick Grimes, who travel in search of a safe and secure home. As the world overrun by the dead takes its toll on the survivors, their interpersonal conflicts present a greater danger to their continuing survival than the walkers that roam the country. Over time, the characters are changed by the constant exposure to death and some grow willing to do anything to survive.

Due to the intense enemy fire, the planes are shot down and most soldiers die in the landing or are killed by the Nazis\' night patrols after they land. However, a private named Ed Boyce survives to find Corporal Ford, a last-minute incorporation from Italy and a veteran expert in bombs and explosives, rogue sniper Tibbet, war photographer Chase, and finally private Dawson. After they watch the killing of their superior Sargeant Eldson by a Nazi night patrol, Ford becomes leader of the group and they try to get the town with the tower in order to complete the mission. In the forest close to the town they meet Chloe, a villager who assists the soldiers in her home with her elderly aunt and little brother Paul. But the mission gets complicated when, by accident, Boyce ends up inside the Nazi radio tower, only to find horrible secret experiments with human beings that could empower a victory for Hitler and would change the fate of the world forever. With D-Day approaching, Boyce and the others begin to realize there is more going on in this Nazi-occupied village than a simple military operation. They not only have to fight against soldiers to destroy the radio tower, but also against the results of the experiments to turn the entire place to ruins. All this before dawn and Hitler gets his Third Reich of a thousand years that he promised.\r\n-\r\nChockys\r\n\r\nOn the eve of D-Day, a paratrooper squad is sent to destroy a German radio tower in an old church; however, their plane is shot down before they can reach their target, leaving only five apparent survivors, Corporal Ford and soldiers Boyce, Tibbet, Chase, and Dawson. Dawson is killed by a landmine but the team continues onward, running into a French woman named Chloe who agrees to take them into the village where the radio tower is located. The soldiers learn that Chloe lives with her 8-year-old brother Paul and her aunt, who has been disfigured by Nazi experiments taking place in the church. After Tibbet and Chase depart to check the scheduled rendezvous site, the remaining soldiers are forced to hide in the attic when a Nazi patrol performs a routine inspection. But when SS HauptsturmfÃ¼hrer Wafner attempts to rape Chloe, Boyce attacks him, forcing the soldiers to take him prisoner..\r\n\r\nD-Day, 6 June 1944. A platoon of US paratroopers enters a village to discover that there is a German laboratory nearby. The Germans are developing a serum that turns their troops into indestructible super-soldiers.

To conceal their crime, the sisters must go deep into the criminal underbelly of their hometown, uncovering the town\'s darkest secrets.\r\n\r\nWelcome to Easter Cove, a remote and insular fishing village on Maine\'s rocky coast. In this small town, bonds run as deep as the ocean and secrets are as thick as the morning fog. Each day, droves of men take to sea for the daily catch while a handful of women serve as the community\'s powerful, albeit discrete, operators. Though the self-interested code of the town\'s old guard has governed for years, our tale takes place as the tides are turning in Easter Cove. Mary Margaret Connolly, a beloved and integral town matriarch, has just passed away. In the wake of her death, her daughters, Mary Beth and Priscilla, face an uncertain future, haunted by bills and unpaid loans left behind. Priscilla tries to fill her mother\'s shoes by taking over the family fish shop while her younger sister Mary Beth refuses to accept the new responsibilities. The sisters find themselves at odds and Mary Beth stubbornly defends her dream of leaving town - even if it means abandoning Priscilla altogether. Meanwhile, across town, at a bed and breakfast-turned-brothel, established town elder and madame Enid Nora Devlin is up to business as usual, except for two huge problems: someone stole $50K in cash and one of her girls, Dee, has gone missing. With little else to do, she sends her muscle, an outsider named Gorski, in pursuit of the cash and Dee. After a series of chance wrong turns sets Gorski on a collision course with Mary Beth, she accidentally kills him and must turn to the only person she has left: her sister. Together, the Connolly sisters must cover up Mary Beth\'s mistake and figure out what to do with the mysterious bag of cash they found in his shack. When Dee\'s body washes up on shore, the town\'s remaining matriarchs - Doreen, Gail and Susie - snap into action. These three, along with Enid and Mary Margaret, have quietly maintained the code of conduct for decades, navigating the murky water of the town\'s dubious past. The matriarchs intervene and make it their business to decide Enid\'s fate - as well as the fate of the Connolly sisters.', 'Blu-ray', 1, 0, '', 0, '0000-00-00', '', '2020-09-17 07:43:43', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Singapore::NC16\r\nUnited Kingdom::N/C 15+\r\nUnited States::R', 16),

On a trip with his brother, Saroo soon finds himself alone and trapped in a moving decommissioned passenger train that takes him to Calcutta, 1000 miles away from home. Now totally lost in an alien urban environment and too young to identify either himself or his home to the authorities, Saroo struggles to survive as a street child until he is sent to an orphanage. Soon, Saroo is selected to be adopted by the Brierley family in Tasmania, where he grows up in a loving, prosperous home. However, for all his material good fortune, Saroo finds himself plagued by his memories of his lost family in his adulthood and tries to search for them even as his guilt drives him to hide this quest from his adoptive parents and his girlfriend.

Kamla works carrying stones during the night shift and Guddu also works in the night in the Central Station. One night, Saroo insists on going with Guddu to his work and does not resist and sleeps. Guddu leaves Saroo sleeping on a bank in the station and asks him to stay there until he returns. However the boy wakes up in the middle of the night and decides to seek out his brother in a train. He sleeps again and he wakes up in Calcutta, West Bengal, and 1,600 km east of Khandwa. Saroo does not speak Bengali, only Hindi, and lives on the street of the big city. One day, a young man brings Saroo to the police station and he is sent of an institution for children. In 1987, Saroo is adopted by an Australian family and moves to Hobart, Tasmania. He is raised with love by his foster parents and one day, he goes to an Indian party promoted by his Indian mates from the university with his girlfriend Lucy.

You stop aging at 25, but there\'s a catch: you\'re genetically-engineered to live only one more year, unless you can buy your way out of it. The rich \"earn\" decades at a time (remaining at age 25), becoming essentially immortal, while the rest beg, borrow or steal enough hours to make it through the day. When a man from the wrong side of the tracks is falsely accused of murder, he is forced to go on the run with a beautiful hostage. Living minute to minute, the duo\'s love becomes a powerful tool in their war against the system.\r\n-\r\nTwentieth Century Fox\r\n\r\nIn a future society, people are genetically modified to stop aging at twenty five and after that a clock is activated with one more year for each citizen. Time is a currency and the wealthy that live in the New Greenwich are immortals while the poor live in ghettos in time zones are exploited and forced to live with a few hours or days, and need to work, borrow, beg or steal to stay alive. Thieves steal time and the timekeepers control the society. When the worker Will Salas saves the rich Henry Hamilton from a dangerous gang of thieves, Henry tells that he is 105 years old and is tired of living, since there is no need for the deaths in the unfair society. When Will sleeps, Henry gives more than one hundred years to him and commits suicide. Will runs to meet his mother Rachel Salas to credit time to her but she dies before the transference. Will heads to New Greenwich but the timekeeper Raymond Leon believes that he killed Henry to steal his time. Will flirts with Sylvia Weis, who is the spoiled daughter of the millionaire Philippe Weis, in a party and when Raymond arrests him, Will Salas kidnaps Sylvia and brings her to the ghetto where he lives. Sylvia feels how despicable her father is and together with Will, they steal a large quantity of time to fight against the system.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nIn a future society people have been engineered not to age once reaching 25 but can only live for one more year as time is now the currency. Those who trade it can live for more than a 100 years. Society\'s classes are divided into what they call time zones. The richest live in the Greenwich section. One of the residents of Greenwich wanders into the poor section where someone sees how much time he has which is 100 years and wants to steal it. Will Salas, a decent guy saves him but he tells Will that he wanted to die because he\'s tired of a system wherein someone has to die for others to live. While Will is sleeping he gives Will his time and walks off to die. Will goes off to share it with his mother but she dies because of inflation. Will heads off to Greenwich. He then meets a girl named Sylvia whose father is the one behind the system. A law enforcement office known as a Timekeeper who\'s investigating the death of the man who gave Will his time, assumes that Will stole it. So he confiscates it and arrests Will. Will then takes Sylvia hostage and runs off with her. He goes back to his time zone and asks for a ransom but when her father doesn\'t give it. He lets her go but when she\'s in danger Will saves her and they decide to work together to take down the system.\r\n-\r\nrcs0411@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nIn the future when the aging gene has been switched off, people must pay to stay alive. To avoid overpopulation, time has become the currency that people use to pay for luxuries and necessities from a clock implanted in their forearm. This can easily be transferred among individuals on body contact. The rich can live forever, while the rest try to negotiate for their immortality. A poor young man is accused of murder when he inherits a fortune of time from a dead upper class man, though too late to help his mother from dying. He is forced to go on the run from a corrupt police force known as \'time keepers\'.\r\n-\r\nNicky Mitchell\r\n\r\nWhen scientists unlock the secret to immortality, time becomes the new currency and one desperate man comes under attack from a mysterious group known only as the \"Time Keepers.\" In the not-too-distant future, scientists have discovered a way to turn off the aging gene. As the threat of overpopulation looms over society, money becomes a thing of the past. Now, assets are measured in time; those with the most time also possess the most power. Meanwhile, the lower classes are forced to barter with the new elite if they want to live forever. Suddenly a young commoner stumbles across a treasure chest of time. With the \"Time Keepers\" in hot pursuit, however, he may never get a chance to use it.', 'Blu-ray', 1, 1, '', 0, '0000-00-00', '', '2020-09-21 09:41:20', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-13\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::12\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::11\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTurkey::G\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13', 12),

They include: actress Amber Waves, who acts as the mother figure to the group in the absence of being a real mother to her biological son, about who she has told no one in her porn circle; actor Reed Rothchild, who wants to live up to his on-screen alpha male status; actor Buck Swope, who works as a stereo salesman on the side and whose country & western style seems to be problematic in getting ahead; actress Rollergirl, a high school drop-out who never takes off her skates; and assistant director \"Little\" Bill, whose marriage is threatened by his wife being both a nymphomaniac and an exhibitionist. Their collective lives are punctuated by excess in everything, whether it be sex, cocaine use, or the need to amass flashy material possessions. Into their lives comes Eddie Adams, a seventeen year old high school dropout from a dysfunctional family in Torrance. Eddie, who renames himself Dirk Diggler, is Jack\'s latest discovery, and whose success in the industry is largely predicated on being well-endowed. Because of the validation he receives for the first time in his life, Dirk is easy prey to be sucked into the excesses of the group. Although largely an innocent beyond the few dollars previously earned here and there by showing his penis to anyone who would pay, Dirk also changes as a person as he displays more and more bravado in relation to the amount of validation he receives. The next few years lead to changes in the group, not only because of changes in technology, namely the advent of video, but as the excesses in their lives start to take their toll, and as their association with the business may affect what their post-porn life will look like.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nFrom writer/director P.T. Anderson comes the turbulent behind-the-scenes story of an extended family of filmmakers who set out to revolutionize the adult entertainment industry in the seventies. Idealistic producer Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) has always dreamed of elevating his films into an art form. When he discovers young actor Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg), Jack begins to turn his dreams into reality. Under the stage name of Dirk Diggler, Eddie soon gives the adult entertainment world a star the likes of which it has never seen. But the rise to fame has its costs, and soon Dirk finds himself sliding down the slippery slope of sex, drugs and violence. The only question: can he get himself back together before it\'s too late?\r\n\r\nEddie Adams would have been just another high-school drop-out had he not met the likes of adult film director Jack Horner. Horner transforms Eddie into Dirk Diggler, a rising-star actor with a special gift. Set in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the film is a tribute to the decor, style, culture, and social attitudes of the era.\r\n-\r\nJohn Selbie\r\n\r\nEddie Adams, a young man working in a nightclub, is discovered by porn director Jack Horner, who soon puts Eddie, renamed Dirk Diggler, and his \"talent\" on the top of the pornography industry. But when the 1980s arrive, Dirk and his colleagues in the porn industry have to cope with a new era as well as the baggage they bring with them from the 1970s.\r\n-\r\nMike Myers\r\n\r\nEddie is an aspiring actor who gets discovered by Jack Horner, a porn director who considers his job an art form. Eddie then changes his name to Dirk Diggler and gets sucked in the lifestyle and relationships of the pornography industry of the late-1970s.\r\n-\r\nSteve Richer', 'Blu-ray', 1, 0, '', 0, '0000-00-00', '', '2020-10-13 10:31:46', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::18\r\nAustralia::R\r\nBrazil::18\r\nCanada::16+\r\nCzech Republic::15\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::16\r\nGermany::16\r\nHong Kong::III\r\nHungary::18\r\nIceland::16\r\nIreland::18\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nJapan::R-15\r\nMalaysia::(Banned)\r\nMexico::C\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R18\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::18\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::R21\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::18\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nUnited Kingdom::18\r\nUnited States::R', 18),

Robbie is the son of a family servant toward whom the family has always been kind. They paid for his time at Cambridge and now he plans on going to medical school. After the fountain incident, Briony reads a letter intended for Cecilia and concludes that Robbie is a deviant. When her cousin Lola (Juno Temple) is raped, she tells the Police that it was Robbie she saw committing the deed.\r\n-\r\ngarykmcd\r\n\r\nIn 1939, Robbie Turner (James McAvoy) is a Private in the British Army, he and his battalion who are heading to France to fight in the war. A stint in the army is not where his life was headed, which took a radical turn four years earlier at the Tallis estate where he grew up as his mother worked as the Tallis\' live-in housekeeper. As such, he grew up with the three Tallis children: son Leon (Patrick Kennedy), and daughters Cecilia (Keira Knightley) and Briony (Saoirse Ronan). Robbie and Cecilia were just getting to the stage of their lives of being able to confess their true love for each other. But then thirteen-year-old aspiring writer Briony also had a crush on the older Robbie. Based on two incidents she saw between Cecilia and Robbie (one only from afar), on reading a private letter Robbie wrote to Cecilia, and on her own feelings for Robbie, Briony told some truths and half-truths about Robbie which resulted in this turn in his life. Robbie is able to reconnect with Cecilia before he is shipped off to France, and lives only to be able to head back to London to be with Cecilia and make up for the missing four years they could not spend together due to Briony\'s actions. A year later, Briony (Romola Garai), now eighteen, also arrives in London to start working as a nurse to support the war effort. By this time, she is aware of the damage her thirteen-year-old self caused, and wants to atone for that error to Cecilia, from whom she has been estranged, and Robbie, who she has not seen since. She will make this atonement even if neither Robbie or Cecilia will ever speak to her, or if it takes the rest of her life.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nThe day that thirteen-year-old Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) came across her older sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley) and her lover Robbie Turner (James McAvoy) making love in the library was a day that would have repercussions for all three of them. Briony misunderstands what has taken place between them and her reaction later tears the two lovers apart perhaps forever as war breaks out in Britain.\r\n-\r\nmel47', 'Blu-ray', 0, 1, '', 0, '0000-00-00', '', '2020-10-13 10:33:03', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::G\r\nFinland::K-12/9\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nIceland::12\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG-12\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNorway::11\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R', 16),

Meanwhile, his garage mechanic boss is trying to set up a race team using gangland money, which implicates our driver as he is to be used as the race team\'s main driver. Our hero gets more than he bargained for when he meets the man who is married to the woman he loves.\r\n-\r\nshin\r\n\r\nIn Los Angeles, a mysterious driver is a man of few words who works as a garage mechanic for his only friend Shannon. He also moonlights as a stuntman in Hollywood films and driver of getaway cars in heists. One day, he helps his neighbor Irene, whose husband is in prison, and her son Benicio and he falls in love with her. However, a few days later her husband Standard Gabriel is released from prison and they meet each other in the building. Standard is pressed by the criminal Cook to rob a pawn shop to pay for the protection he had in prison, and the driver decides to help him by driving the getaway car. However, the heist does not work as planned, and now the driver finds he has to protect Irene and Benicio from mobsters.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nThis film is about a \'driver\' (Ryan Gosling) who works at a garage fixing cars, but also drives stunt cars in movies. He also does some getaway driving to earn extra cash. He gets close with a woman, Irene, and her child, who is his neighbor. Her husband gets released from prison and and owes some people money, so the \'driver\' ends up doing a job with him. But it goes wrong and the \'driver\' ends up in a crime he didn\'t want to be involved in. Can he protect the people that he now cares about?\r\n-\r\nRyan Gosling\r\n\r\nA young man, who shall be referred to as the Driver, has several jobs all related to vehicles, and all at which he is extremely good: movie stunt driver, mechanic, and getaway driver for criminals. In the latter job, he drives, no more and no less, the no more including not carrying a gun, but he takes his job seriously in making a clean getaway while keeping his clients safe during their time in the car. The Driver\'s mechanic boss, Shannon, who often gets him and oversees his stunt jobs, wants to expand their horizons by getting into the racing business. Shannon convinces a mob acquaintance, Bernie Rose, and Bernie\'s associate Nino to finance this venture after Bernie meets the Driver. Concurrently, the Driver starts to fall for one of his neighbors, Irene, and her young son, Benicio. Irene\'s husband, Standard Gabriel, is a petty criminal currently in prison. Solely to protect Irene and Benicio, the Driver gets involved in Standard\'s criminal life once Standard is released from prison. That criminal life takes an unexpected turn which threatens not only the Driver\'s relationship with Irene and Benicio and his possible new life as a race car driver, but his life, period, as Standard ends up unwittingly being connected back to Rose and Nino.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nDefined entirely by his profession, by day, the nameless phlegmatic driver is a mechanic and a daredevil stuntman for high-paced action movies, but by night, he\'s a masterful getaway wheelman for criminals. But when an unexpected encounter with Irene, the Driver\'s vulnerable neighbour and mother of a young son, stirs a spontaneous affection, things will soon take a turn for the worse, as a reluctant job with her ex-con husband ends up in a bloody mess. Now, on the run, blood-stained, and with a bag crammed with the Mafia\'s cash, the Driver not only has to save himself, but also to protect the defenceless Irene and her child. For years, the stoic Driver has been executing to perfection his precise escapes.

Little does he know, Sarah\'s traveling to the same resort as her ex - and she\'s bringing along her new boyfriend.\r\n-\r\nIMDb Editors\r\n\r\nPeter is a composer and a likable sad sack who\'s devastated when his girlfriend of five years, Sarah Marshall, the star of a cheesy CSI-style crime show, dumps him. He weeps, he rails, he mopes. Finally, his step-brother Brian suggests a vacation, so Peter heads for a resort on Oahu where, as he\'s checking in, he sees Sarah and her new beau, Aldous, a perverse English rocker. The weeping and moping start again, until Peter is rescued by Rachel, a thoughtful hotel clerk who invites him to a luau and to hang out. Although he constantly runs into Sarah and Aldous, Peter starts to come alive again. Will Sarah realize what she\'s lost, and what about Rachel?\r\n-\r\n\r\nComposer and musician Peter Bretter, unmotivated in life, is unceremoniously dumped by his girlfriend of five and half years, Sarah Marshall, the star of the hit television show, Crime Scene. Peter is devastated as he is in love with Sarah, who has left him for another undisclosed man. The situation is made all the more difficult for Peter as he also works on Crime Scene. Peter\'s stepbrother, Brian Bretter, trying to be his voice of reason, tells Peter among other things to go away on vacation to forget about Sarah. The place Peter chooses is the Turtle Bay Resort in Hawaii, a place where Sarah had mentioned wanting to go. So it is not totally coincidental that upon Peter\'s arrival, he finds that Sarah is also there with her new boyfriend Aldous Snow, the pretentious lead singer for the band Infant Sorrow. Peter\'s plan of forgetting about Sarah is impossible, of which the staff and many of the guests at the hotel are aware, but neither Peter or Sarah refuse to let the other\'s presence at the resort make them run away. With the help of Brian, Brian\'s wife Liz and the hotel staff, Peter tries to move on with his life specifically with Rachel Jansen, one of the customer service agents at the hotel, who is carrying some emotional baggage of her own. But Peter goes into a further emotional tailspin when Sarah\'s life also takes a turn.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nWhen Sarah Marshall dumps aspiring musician Peter Bretter for rock star Aldous Snow, Peter\'s world comes crashing down. His best friend suggests that Peter should get away from everything and to fly off to Hawaii to escape all his problems. After arriving in Hawaii and meeting the beautiful Rachel Jansen, Peter is shocked to see not only Aldous Snow in Hawaii, but also Sarah Marshall.\r\n-\r\nFilmFanUk', 'Blu-ray', 1, 0, '', 0, '0000-00-00', '', '2020-10-13 10:38:16', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::18+\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-15\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nIceland::12\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::R18+\r\nMalaysia::18PL\r\nMexico::C\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::11\r\nPeru::14\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R', 16),

Though separated by time and space, both women are at loose ends... until they discover that with the right combination of passion, fearlessness and butter, anything is possible.\r\n-\r\nColumbia Pictures\r\n\r\nIn 1949, Julia Child is in Paris, the wife of a diplomat, wondering how to spend her days. She tries hat making, bridge, and then cooking lessons at Cordon Bleu. There she discovers her passion. In 2002, Julie Powell, about to turn 30 and underemployed with an unpublished novel, decides to cook her way through \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\" in a year and to blog about it. We go back and forth between these stories of two women learning to cook and finding success. Sympathetic, loving husbands support them both, and friendships, too, add zest.\r\n-\r\n\r\nIn 1949, the diplomat Paul Child and his wife Julia are expatriated to France. In Paris, the bored Julia decides to learn how to cook and later to write a book teaching American housewives how to cook French cuisine. In 2002, the frustrated secretary of a government agency Julie and her husband, the editor Eric Powell, move to an apartment in Queens over a pizzeria. Julie is an aspirant writer and loves to cook and her husband suggests her to write a blog to spend her leisure time. Julie decides to write a blog about cooking and commits herself to cook the 534 recipes written by Julia Child in her book in 365 days.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nIn 1949, American diplomat Paul Child starts a four year posting in Paris. His wife, the physically imposing Julia Child, loves Paris life, especially the food which she finds a revelation, but has no idea what to do with her time. She decides to parlay that love of the French cuisine by taking a cooking class. Believing she is not at the beginner level, she is able to convince the snooty head of the Cordon Bleu to enroll in a class for aspiring professional chefs. Her fellow students, all young men, see her solely as a bored housewife, so she tries to prove them wrong by cooking with what she considers fearlessness. Julia eventually meets Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle, who are working on among other things an English language French cookbook, which Julia would herself like as she is unable to find such. She eventually becomes a collaborator on that book, which she wants to make accessible for the average American. The book has a difficult road to publication, if it gets published at all, which is made all the more difficult with Paul\'s subsequent postings and Julia moving away from Paris. In 2002, thirty year old Julie Powell is floundering in her life. She wanted to be a writer, but works as a low level bureaucrat in a thankless job for the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, dealing with the sad and/or angry calls from people affected by 9/11. Although she regularly has what she calls her \"cobb salad\" luncheons with them, she neither really likes or understands her Amherst College \"friends\", whose lives have all turned out the way they wanted. And she reluctantly moves to an apartment over a pizzeria in Queens from Brooklyn largely so that her magazine editor husband Eric Powell can be closer to his job and they can save money, of which they don\'t have much. Beyond her time with Eric, Julie\'s only sanctuary is cooking. To find some meaning in her life, Julie, on Eric\'s encouragement, decides to write a blog, the topic she chooses being her year long journey to cook the 524 recipes in Julia Child\'s \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\". Julie is determined to complete this project, project completion which has been sorely lacking in her life. It becomes the primary focus in her life, which contains its frequent meltdowns, which Eric is unsure if he can handle as part of this life. What keeps Julie largely going is the spirit of Julia, who she considers perfect, who she hopes knows about and understands her journey, and who she would someday like to meet.

But a heated custody battle ensues over the divorced couple\'s son, deepening the wounds left by the separation.\r\n\r\nTed Kramer is a career man for whom his work comes before his family. His wife Joanna cannot take this anymore, so she decides to leave him. Ted is now faced with the tasks of housekeeping and taking care of himself and their young son Billy. When he has learned to adjust his life to these new responsibilities, Joanna resurfaces and wants Billy back. Ted, however, refuses to give him up, so they go to court to fight for the custody of their son.\r\n-\r\nLeon Wolters\r\n\r\nUp and coming New York advertising executive Ted Kramer believes that his role and responsibility to his family is to be the household breadwinner, which means a focus on career. Joanna Kramer, his wife of eight years, is relegated to role of housewife and mother to their five and a half year old son, Billy Kramer, as Ted doesn\'t want her to work outside the house. As such, Joanna, on the encouragement of Margaret Phelps, a recent divorcÃ©e in their apartment building and one of Joanna\'s primary confidantes, decides to abandon the marriage, and leave Billy with Ted, as she feels she can\'t properly take care of Billy in her current fragile mental state. Ted believes that Joanna is solely going through a phase, and that she will return home in a day or two, which she doesn\'t. So, Ted has to make some major adjustments in his life. Beyond the time of fitting in Joanna\'s duties into his work schedule, Ted is ill equipped to take care of the household chores and be Billy\'s sole caregiver, which is made more difficult as Billy has his own ill feelings about the entire situation. Ted and Billy go through a difficult period in learning how to deal with each other as father and son, but the relationship eventually blossoms into a truly loving one, with Margaret being one of their biggest supporters. Two issues threaten Ted and Billy\'s new-found familial happiness: the negative effect his new time priority with Billy has on maintaining a productive work life, and the arrival fifteen months later of a newly confidant Joanna, who wants custody of her son.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nOn the same day Manhattan advertising executive Ted Kramer lands the biggest account of his career, he learns that his wife, Joanna, is leaving him and their young son, Billy. Forced to raise his son alone, Ted loses his job but gains a stronger relationship with the child with the help of another single parent, Margaret. When Joanna returns to claim custody of Billy, the ensuing court battle takes a toll on everyone concerned.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nOut of the blue, after eight years, the workaholic, up-and-coming advertising executive, Ted Kramer, finds himself with his back to the wall when his emotionally fatigued wife, Joanna, announces that she wants out of the marriage. As a result, left all alone to care for their innocent six-year-old son, Billy, Ted must reinvent the father-and-son relationship, and make up for lost time. Suddenly, being a single parent becomes a daunting task, and as if that weren\'t enough, after eighteen long and challenging months, Joanna re-enters Ted\'s life, bent on claiming custody of her little boy. But, Ted will never let go of his son. Can there be any winners when a family is in ruins?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas', 'Blu-ray', 1, 0, '', 0, '0000-00-00', '', '2020-10-13 10:43:01', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::NRC\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::G\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::S\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-8\r\nHong Kong::I\r\nIndia::U\r\nIndonesia::D\r\nIreland::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::A\r\nNetherlands::AL\r\nNigeria::G\r\nNorway::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSaudi Arabia::G\r\nSingapore::NC16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSweden::11\r\nUnited Kingdom::PG\r\nUnited States::PG\r\nWest Germany::16', 0),

In their research they discover how flawed and corrupt the market is.\r\n-\r\ngrantss\r\n\r\nThree separate but parallel stories of the U.S mortgage housing crisis of 2005 are told. Michael Burry, an eccentric ex-physician turned one-eyed Scion Capital hedge fund manager, has traded traditional office attire for shorts, bare feet and a Supercuts haircut. He believes that the US housing market is built on a bubble that will burst within the next few years. Autonomy within the company allows Burry to do largely as he pleases, so Burry proceeds to bet against the housing market with the banks, who are more than happy to accept his proposal for something that has never happened in American history. The banks believe that Burry is a crackpot and therefore are confident in that they will win the deal. Jared Vennett with Deutschebank gets wind of what Burry is doing and, as an investor believes he too can cash in on Burry\'s beliefs. An errant telephone call to FrontPoint Partners gets this information into the hands of Mark Baum, an idealist who is fed up with the corruption in the financial industry. Baum and his associates, who work at an arms length under Morgan Stanley, decide to join forces with Vennett despite not totally trusting him. In addition to Burry\'s information, they further believe that most of the mortgages are overrated by the bond agencies, with the banks collating all the sub-prime mortgages under AAA packages. Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley, who are minor players in a $30 million start-up garage company called Brownfield, get a hold of Vennett\'s prospectus on the matter. Wanting in on the action but not having the official clout to play, they decide to call an old \"friend\", retired investment banker Ben Rickert, to help out. All three of these groups work on the premise that the banks are stupid and don\'t know what\'s going on, while for them to win, the general economy has to lose, which means the suffering of the general investor who trusts the financial institutions. That latter aspect may not sit well with Baum. Some of these assumptions may be incorrect and may be far more manipulative than they could have ever imagined, which in turn may throw curves into the process.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nBased on the book by Michael Lewis (writer of Moneyball, Liar\'s Poker and Flash Boys, among others), the true story of a handful of investors who bet against the US mortgage market in 2006-7. Through their own research they discovered that the US mortgage backed securities market was a bubble about to burst, and they invested accordingly. What they didn\'t initially know was how structurally flawed the MBS system was, the level of corruption in the market...and the impact on the average person when the bubble burst.\r\n-\r\ngrantss\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Wall Street guru Michael Burry realizes that a number of subprime home loans are in danger of defaulting. Burry bets against the housing market by throwing more than $1 billion of his investors\' money into credit default swaps. His actions attract the attention of banker Jared Vennett, hedge-fund specialist Mark Baum and other greedy opportunists. Together, these men make a fortune by taking full advantage of the impending economic collapse in America.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nSensing the imminent danger of a financial crisis based on inconspicuous warning signs in the mortgage-backed real estate market, back in 2008, a motley crew of bold, yet shrewd and skilful investors managed to reap immense profits just by betting against the housing market. Who could have predicted that a real-estate bubble of a such a magnitude was about to burst, and above all, what could be the devastating aftermath in a crumbling economy that left practically millions unemployed and homeless?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nChristian Bale plays Michael Burry, a former hedge-fund manager who was one of the first to forecast the collapse of the credit bubble due to excessive subprime lending.

He sneaks out early one morning to meet his best friend, Neckbone (Jacob Lofland). Neckbone, also 14, lives with his uncle, Galen (Michael Shannon), who makes a hardscrabble living diving for oysters. The two boys set out to an island on the Mississippi River, where Neckbone has discovered an unusual sight-a boat, suspended high in the trees, a remnant of an extreme flood some time in the past. They climb the tree and into the boat only to find fresh bread and fresh footprints. Realizing that they are not the only ones who have discovered the treehouse boat, they decide to leave. When they reach the shore, they find the same footprint in their boat. And that\'s when they meet Mud (Matthew McConaughey). Mud is a gritty, superstitious character; his clothes are dirty, his tooth is cracked, and he needs help. He tells the boys he will give them the treehouse boat, his current hideout, in exchange for food. Neckbone is reluctant, but Ellis brings food to Mud, and they develop a tentative friendship. Ellis learns that Mud has killed a man in Texas, and police and bounty hunters are looking for him, but Mud is more concerned about reuniting with his longtime love, Juniper (Reese Witherspoon). Ellis, who has recently developed his own crush, agrees to help Mud escape with Juniper. Ellis and Neckbone carry out bold schemes in an effort to protect Mud and relay messages to Juniper, who is holed up in a fleabag motel, under constant surveillance by Carver (Paul Sparks), a Texas bounty hunter. Carver and his gang are intent on capturing Mud, on orders from the cold-blooded King (Joe Don Baker). As the boys risk everything to reunite these seeming mythical lovers, Ellis\'s own ideas about love and romance are challenged by the strains in the relationships closest to him: his parents\' marriage is dissolving while he himself falters in his efforts to impress May Pearl (Bonnie Sturdivant). Through it all, Ellis struggles to look for an example of love that he can believe in, learning about the unspoken rules and risks of love and the reality of heartbreak.\r\n-\r\nRoadside Attractions\r\n\r\nIn Arkansas, 14-year-old Ellis lives in a floating house with his mother Mary Lee and his father Senior. Ellis helps his father selling fish with his best friend Neckbone. Ellis and Neckbone find a motorboat stranded on the top of a tree in an island on the Mississippi River since a flood and they plan to fix the boat for them. One day, they climb the tree and they find fresh meal inside the boat meaning that someone is living in \"their\" boat. They leave the place and meet a man named Mud near their boat. Soon they learn that the passionate Mud killed a man that had beaten up his girlfriend Juniper and now the father and the brother of the deceased man are hunting him down. Mud makes a deal with the romantic Ellis and Neckbone to help him to reunite with Juniper. But when Ellis meets Mud\'s stepfather Tom, he has a different opinion about the love of Juniper with Mud.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nMississippi adolescents Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) are exploring along the mighty Mississippi when they stumble upon a small island inhabited by Mud (Matthew McConaughey), a desperado who claims to be on the run from brutal bounty hunters after killing a man in Texas. According to Mud, his true love Juniper (Reese Witherspoon) is awaiting his arrival in town, and together they plan to make a daring escape. Fascinated, the two boys agree to help Mud slip past his pursuers, despite the potential dangers of doing so..\r\n\r\nWith a pile of problems at home, and after hearing the fascinating rumour about a boat washed up into a tree on a small Mississippi island, the fourteen-year-old Arkansas boy, Ellis, and his best friend, Neckbone, summon up the courage to enter the mighty river. Indeed, such an unexpected treasure does exist; however, the mysterious tattooed gunman he calls himself Mud, he, too, lays claim to the vessel, unless the teenage adventurers agree to bring him food and help him find Juniper: his only true love. Now, as a formidable posse of Texan bounty hunters is after Mud, Ellis and Neckbone embark on a dangerous mission to reunite the doomed lovers, even if their reckless decision brings them face-to-face with grave consequences. Will they risk it all in the name of love?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nEllis and his friend Neckbone are two boys who meet Mud, a fugitive hiding out on an island in the Mississippi. Skeptical but intrigued by his fantastic scenarios, Ellis and Neckbone agree to help him.

Electrician and sometimes rodeo bull rider Ron Woodroof lives hard, which includes heavy smoking, drinking, drug use (primarily cocaine) and casual sex. He is racist and homophobic. While in the hospital on a work related injury, the doctors discover and inform him that he is HIV+, and that he will most-likely die within thirty days. Ron is initially in angry denial that he would have a disease that only \"faggots\" have, but upon quick reflection comes to the realization that the diagnosis is probably true. He begins to read whatever research is available about the disease, which at this time seems to be most effectively treated by the drug AZT. AZT, however, is only in the clinical trials stage within the US. Incredulous that he, as a dying man, cannot pay for any drug which may save or at least prolong his life, he goes searching for it by whatever means possible. It eventually leads him to Mexico and a \"Dr.\" Vass, an American physician whose license was revoked in the US because of his AIDS related work against US regulations. Dr. Vass leads Ron to a cocktail of other drugs, some vitamins, he believes are more effective in treating the symptoms, since the virus, as Ron learns, will always be in the system of those who have been exposed to it. Ron begins to smuggle these drugs not approved by the FDA into the US, not only for his own use but for sale to other HIV+ persons. In this venture, he goes into an unlikely partnership with a HIV+ transgender woman named Rayon, who he met in the hospital and who has greater contact with AIDS patients through the gay community. As they try to work both above ground to get the meds to those that need them and underground to avoid detection by especially the FDA, Ron comes up with an idea to circumvent the fact of selling the drugs - which are not considered drugs yet since they are not FDA approved - directly to the HIV+ population, which then should should not be against the law. Richard Barkley and Dr. Sevard, the FDA\'s lead man on the file and one of Ron\'s doctors respectively, the latter who sees clinical trials as the only way to determine the efficacy of drugs despite the fact that Ron and others would have probably died already without these drugs, try to stop Ron and Rayon at every turn. Caught in the middle is Dr. Eve Saks, another of Ron\'s doctors, who understands why policies are in place, but who can sympathize with Ron, Rayon and others - all her patients, directly or indirectly - in their situation.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nIn 1985, in Dallas, the homophobic electrician and rodeo rider Ron Woodroof is a cocaine user who frequently has sex with hookers and promiscuous women. When he has an accident at work, he is sent to the hospital where Dr. Sevard and Dr. Eve tell him that he is HIV+ and will die within thirty days. Ron also meets trans-gender Rayon, who is drug addicted and also has the disease. Ron does not accept the diagnosis but a couple of days later he realizes that it may be accurate. He researches about the disease and learns that AZT might be lethal for infected people. Further, he discovers that in Mexico there is a doctor with revoked license named Vass that uses alternative drugs in the treatment of AIDS. Ron improves his health and decides to sell the drugs in Dallas. He makes a partnership with Rayon and soon he creates the Dallas Buyers Club, where the memberships pay four hundred dollars per month to have the necessary drugs. But the FDA does not accept his research and he is oppressed by the authorities.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nRon Woodroof is a man living in Texas in 1985. He drinks, does drugs and sleeps with women, a real alpha male. When he gets injured at work, he is brought to the hospital and as a procedure, they test his blood and when they get the result, they tell him that he has the HIV virus which causes AIDS. They tell him that he has 30 days to get his affairs in order. He doesn\'t believe them because like most people at the time, he thinks only homosexuals get the disease. When he gets worse, he learns of the drug AZT which can treat the disease. But it\'s not available to the public so he finds someone who works in a lab and pays him to provide him with it. But when he tells Woodroof he can\'t get it anymore, Woodroof needs it so he tells Woodroof of a doctor in Mexico who treats people with AIDS. Woodroof goes there and finds the doctor who treats him. After awhile, Woodroof is doing better. The doctor tells him that he doesn\'t use AZT because it only makes things worse, so he uses his own remedies. Woodroof decides to sell the doctors meds in the US which the medical community refuses to accept. He finds people who want it and business is booming. Eventually the government tries to stop him but he finds a way around them.\r\n-\r\nrcs0411@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nIn mid 1980s Texas, electrician Ron Woodroof is starting to learn that he has AIDS.

To support his family, Brendan now teaches high school science and has largely left his fighting life behind him. After his mother\'s death, Tommy served time in the military. Tommy returns home to find a changed Paddy, one who has been clean and sober for almost three years and who has rediscovered religion, both which he feels has completely turned his life around from who he was when Tommy left fourteen years ago, although Tommy is not convinced. The lives of the Conlons may intersect when they all fall back into mixed martial arts (MMA), Tommy in trying to discover what his post-military life holds, and as Brendan finds that his teaching is insufficient to pay all the family bills, with fighting and teaching seemingly incompatible. With a $5 million winner-takes-all prize for a MMA tournament as the carrot, Tommy and Brendan and by association Paddy\'s interrelationships may either be strengthen or further torn apart, both figuratively and literally, if they take part in this very public and potentially violent arena.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nTwo estranged brothers and Mixed Martial Arts fighters confront the forces that tore their family apart as they prepare to do battle in the ring in this drama from director Gavin O\'Connor (Pride and Glory). Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) is an ex-Marine from Pittsburgh who\'s never quite shaken his troubled past. Upon learning that the purse in an upcoming MMA tournament is the largest in the league\'s history, Tommy recruits his father, Paddy (Nick Nolte), a former coach and recovering alcoholic, to whip him into shape in time for the competition. Meanwhile, as Tommy steadily ascends the ranks by defeating one powerful opponent after another, his brother, Brendan, struggles to provide for his family with his job as a public school teacher. A former MMA fighter with a devastating punch, Brendan begins to wonder if he, too, could have a shot at winning the coveted purse. In time, Brendan and Tommy both emerge as dark horse contenders in the competition, setting the two brothers on a brutal collision course. But Tommy and Brendan\'s biggest battle won\'t be fought in the ring -- it will be fought in their hearts and minds.\r\n\r\nAfter a long decade of estrangement with his repentant alcoholic father, the fresh-out-of-Iraq ex-Marine, Tommy Conlon, returns to his hometown of Pittsburgh, bent on getting back to the ring of Sparta: a winner-takes-all, no-holds-barred mixed martial arts tournament. As Tommy trains for the title and the $5 million purse, the underdog, Brendan--Tommy\'s alienated older brother, and high school science teacher who struggles to eke out a living--fights his way into the warlike tournament to save his family. Now--against the backdrop of bitter resentment, mutual animosity, and a troubled past--the two brothers will have to lock horns with each other in a brutal final battle. However, family is forever, through thick and thin. Amid pain and suffering, can Tommy and Brendan reconcile, and, maybe, find redemption?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas', 'Blu-ray', 1, 0, '', 0, '0000-00-00', '', '2021-01-27 07:58:06', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'Australia::M\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::13+\r\nFrance::Tous Public\r\nGermany::16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::15\r\nItaly::T\r\nMalaysia::18\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSweden::15\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13', 12),

Joel and Ethan Coen provide the script. Louis (Jack O\'Connell) grows up a rough-hew kid on the verge of becoming a full-on delinquent, until his brother starts training him to be a track star. Louis excels at the sport, and eventually represents America at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. During his training, he learns to become resilient and disciplined; his brother\'s words of advice, \"If you can take it, you can make it,\" push him to overcome any adversity. He must live up to that adage under the most extreme circumstances after his plane is shot down during another bombing raid.
